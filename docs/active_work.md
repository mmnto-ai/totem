# Active Work

## Current Focus: The Reflex Engine

We are currently focusing on the **Reflex Engine** (Epic #19).

Our goal is to ensure that a user who installs Totem does not have to spend 20 minutes coaxing their AI to use the tools.

### Active Tasks

1. Upgrading `totem init` to auto-inject System Prompts into `CLAUDE.md`, `.gemini/gemini.md`, etc.
2. Automating git hooks so `totem sync` runs in the background.

## Next Up

After the Reflex Engine is robust, we will begin porting the workflow commands (`totem spec`, `totem shield`) for Epic #20 (The Workflow Orchestrator).
