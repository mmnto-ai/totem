## 1.5.6

### Patch Changes

- fc607ce: ### 1.5.6 — Foundation & Hardening

  **Features:**
  - Unified Findings Model (`TotemFinding`) — common output schema for lint and shield (ADR-071)
  - `totem-context:` is now the primary override directive; `shield-context:` remains as silent alias
  - `totem lint --format json` now includes a `findings[]` array alongside `violations[]`
  - safe-regex validation for user-supplied DLP patterns — ReDoS-vulnerable patterns rejected at input time

  **Fixes:**
  - `matchesGlob()` now correctly handles `*.test.*` and `dir/*.test.*` patterns (was doing literal string match)
  - `readRegistry()` differentiates ENOENT from permission/parse errors via `onWarn` callback
  - `TotemParseError` used for schema validation failures (was generic `Error`)
  - Git hooks path resolved via `git rev-parse --git-path` (supports worktrees and custom `core.hooksPath`)
  - `shield-hints.ts` uses `log.dim()` instead of raw ANSI escape codes
  - `store.count()` failure no longer breaks sync
  - `maxBuffer` (10MB) added to git diff commands — prevents ENOBUFS on large branch diffs
  - Windows `ENOTEMPTY` flake fixed with `maxRetries` in test cleanup

  **Chores:**
  - Dynamic imports in `doctor.ts` for startup latency
  - 8 new lessons extracted from bot reviews (305 compiled rules)
  - Audited and removed 6 `totem-ignore` suppressions
  - Updated compiled baseline hash and scope for JSON.parse rule

## 1.5.5

### Patch Changes

- 19de6b1: feat: categorized triage UX for bot review comments (#956)
  feat: doctor --pr — autonomous rule downgrading (#961)
  feat: auto-format staged files in pre-commit hook

## 1.5.4

### Patch Changes

- 7f5d4e7: feat: user-defined secrets — custom DLP patterns (#921)
  feat: Local Trap Ledger — capture exceptions to NDJSON (#960)
  feat: /review-learn — extract lessons from bot PR reviews (#930)
  fix: SARIF output emits error-severity findings only
  fix: SARIF warning summary as single note annotation

## 1.5.3

### Patch Changes

- ### Shield Redesign — Structured Verdicts + Deterministic Fast-Path (#910)
  - Three-stage pipeline: file classification → hybrid diff filtering → Zod-validated JSON findings
  - Non-code diffs (docs, YAML, config) skip LLM entirely for instant PASS
  - Severity levels (CRITICAL/WARN/INFO) with deterministic pass/fail — LLM no longer decides the gate
  - V1 regex fallback for custom `.totem/prompts/shield.md` overrides

  ### Compile Pipeline Reliability (#939, #941)
  - Pre-push hook auto-verifies compile manifest; auto-compiles if stale then aborts push
  - `totem lint` emits non-blocking staleness warning when manifest is out of date
  - Compiler normalizes shallow fileGlobs (`*.ts` → `**/*.ts`) for external tool compatibility
  - `sanitizeFileGlobs` guards against non-string and empty entries

  ### CLI Performance (#943)
  - Converted ~90 static imports to dynamic `await import()` across 25 command files
  - Heavy modules only loaded when the specific command is executed
  - Startup latency reduced for lightweight operations (`--help`, `--version`)

  ### Error Logging (#849)
  - Standardized `[Totem Error]` prefix across all CLI error output
  - `handleError` now consistently tags errors with guard against double-prefixing

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- ### 1.5.0 — Open Ecosystem

  **New Commands**
  - `totem list` — discover all Totem workspaces via global registry (`~/.totem/registry.json`)
  - `totem doctor` — run 6 diagnostic checks (config, rules, hooks, embedding, index, secret leaks)

  **Features**
  - Language-agnostic hook installation — hooks resolve `totem` binary at runtime via `command -v`, fall back to package manager `dlx` commands
  - Hook manager helper scripts — `.totem/hooks/*.sh` generated for Husky/Lefthook/simple-git-hooks integration
  - `userFacing` flag on DocTarget for scoped post-processing
  - Smart shield review hints — auto-detects DLP artifacts, test files, new files in diff
  - `// shield-context:` inline annotations for per-file shield guidance
  - `.totem/prompts/shield.md` override with verdict format enforcement

  **SARIF Improvements**
  - Tool name corrected: `totem-shield` → `totem-lint`
  - `helpUri` per rule links to wiki
  - Rich annotation messages with lesson context and rule ID

  **Research**
  - Binary distribution spike: full standalone blocked by LanceDB (144MB native), Lite-tier binary feasible

  **CI/DX**
  - Compile Manifest Attestation skips docs-only PRs via path filter
  - Wiki reorganization: internal docs converted to Totem lessons
  - Shield documentation: new "Working with Shield" wiki page

## 1.4.3

### Patch Changes

- DX hardening, core refactor, and docs overhaul.

  **Core:**
  - Extract `buildCompiledRule()`, `buildManualRule()`, `compileLesson()` to core package — eliminates duplicated rule-building logic between local and cloud compilation paths

  **CLI:**
  - Reduce pre-push hook verbosity: dot reporter by default, full output on failure, `TOTEM_DEBUG=1` for verbose mode
  - Suppress gh CLI stderr leak in multi-repo issue fetch
  - Extract shared `ghExecOptions()` with `GH_PROMPT_DISABLED=1` to prevent interactive auth hangs
  - Protect `<manual_content>` blocks from `stripMarketingTerms` mutation

  **Config:**
  - Remove `**/*.test.ts` from `ignorePatterns` so shield can see test files in diffs

  **Docs:**
  - Rewrite README as technical spec sheet (~130 lines, zero marketing)
  - Create SECURITY.md with full 1.4.x audit
  - Scaffold `docs/wiki/` with enforcement model, MCP setup, cross-repo mesh, troubleshooting
  - Add 6 placeholder wiki pages for 1.5.0 features

## 1.4.2

### Patch Changes

- f1509d3: Post-1.4.0 quality sweep (Proposal 189): security fixes, broken functionality, 154 new tests, quality hardening, DRY cleanup, and compile manifest CI attestation

## 1.4.1

### Patch Changes

- ec5b807: Security sweep: fix sanitizer regex statefulness (#871), secret pattern ordering (#872), extract parser injection vector (#873), SQL escaping (#874), and add compile manifest CI attestation (#875)

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

#### Security Hardening

### Core (`@mmnto/totem`)

- **AST engines fail-closed** — query/parse errors now throw `TotemParseError` instead of silently returning empty arrays (#848)
- **Compile manifest signing** — `totem compile` writes `.totem/compile-manifest.json` with SHA-256 provenance chain (#842)
- **XML trust boundaries** — new `wrapUntrustedXml()` for network-fetched content, existing `wrapXml()` preserved for trusted local diffs (#843)
- **Tag name validation** — both XML wrappers validate tag names against injection (#843)
- **DLP secret masking** — `maskSecrets()` utility with centralized `rethrowAsParseError` and `getErrorMessage` helpers (#848, #strategy-12)
- **247 compiled rules** (up from 230)

### CLI (`@mmnto/cli`)

- **Wind tunnel SHA lock** — `tools/update-wind-tunnel-sha.sh` with CI verification job (#840)
- **`totem verify-manifest`** — zero-LLM CI command to verify compiled rules match source lessons (#842)
- **Docs confirmation gate** — `totem docs` requires interactive confirmation or `--yes` before writing LLM output (#847)
- **Marketing term stripping** — case-preserving deterministic replacement, preserves code blocks and URLs (#833)
- **DLP middleware** — `maskSecrets` runs before every outbound LLM call, bypasses local providers (#strategy-12)

### MCP (`@mmnto/mcp`)

- **add_lesson auth model** — Zod schema validation, rate limiting (10/session), source provenance, heading sanitization (#844)

## 1.3.19

### Patch Changes

- feat: markdown-magic deterministic doc injection
  - Integrated markdown-magic with 4 transforms (RULE_COUNT, HOOK_LIST, CHMOD_HOOKS, COMMAND_TABLE)
  - Wired docs:inject into totem wrap pipeline (step 5/6, after LLM docs, before compile)
  - 9 unit tests for transforms, runs in 0.02s
  - Eliminates stale hardcoded values in docs across releases

## 1.3.18

### Patch Changes

- feat: invisible sync hooks (ADR-066)
  - Post-merge hook only syncs when `.totem/lessons/` files change (git diff-tree conditional)
  - New post-checkout hook syncs on branch switch when `.totem/` differs
  - `totem sync --quiet` flag for silent background hook execution
  - Deterministic end markers for safe eject scrubbing
  - DRY scrubHook helper with try/catch and exact marker matching
  - 230 compiled rules (19 new), 697 lessons

## 1.3.17

### Patch Changes

- God Object cleanup: extract.ts (804→566), shield.ts (587→475), audit.ts (560→510), lance-store.ts (523→285). Suspicious lesson detection + semantic dedup moved to core. Nit extraction from CodeRabbit review bodies. Compiler quality gate for untested error rules. Wind tunnel CI gate.

## 1.3.16

### Patch Changes

- Universal Baseline grows from 15 → 23 rules (8 Gemini-validated ast-grep patterns). Wind tunnel: 9 test fixtures + ast-grep test runner fix. Adversarial corpus (16 clean-room fixtures). TypeScript detection for monorepo per-package tsconfig.json.

## 1.3.15

### Patch Changes

- Rule audit Phase 4: kill bad patterns, scope noisy rules, extract lessons from PR 816. Full audit progression: 2,713 → 555 violations (0 on enforcement path).

## 1.3.14

### Patch Changes

- Rule audit: kill 70 garbage rules, dedup 18 overlaps (327 → 239). Docs prompt fix: strip issue refs from user-facing output. README cleanup.

## 1.3.13

### Patch Changes

- Spec template tests (#805), spec/compile prompt extraction (#806, #799), compiler utility tests, prompt versioning, post-compact gate strengthening

## 1.3.12

### Patch Changes

- Agent workflow doc, spec straitjacket upgrade (militant red flags + Graphviz), lean GEMINI.md, PostCompact agent discipline reminder

## 1.3.11

### Patch Changes

- 0b47c94: Security hardening: regex escape, shell:true removal, SQL backtick escape. CodeRabbit integration with path instructions. onWarn logging for AST catch blocks. Unsafe non-null assertions replaced.

## 1.3.10

### Patch Changes

- ceb8663: Context engineering (ADR-063): lean CLAUDE.md router pattern, PostCompact capability manifest, phase-gate enforcement (spec warning before commit). Fixed doc regen hallucination loop.

## 1.3.9

### Patch Changes

- 48cd644: Named index partitions for context isolation. Backfilled body text for 125 Pipeline 1 lessons. Consolidated near-duplicate rules (146 → 144).

## 1.3.8

### Patch Changes

- 16e6071: Context isolation boundary parameter for search_knowledge MCP tool. Consolidated near-duplicate rules (146 → 144).

## 1.3.7

## 1.3.6

### Patch Changes

- 09153f8: Pipeline 1 backfill: 127 curated rules now compile deterministically (zero LLM). Added .totem/lessons/ to .prettierignore. Workflow automation hooks and skills for Claude Code.

## 1.3.5

### Patch Changes

- 5810bcc: ### Knowledge Quality & Security
  - All 59 universal baseline lessons now include actionable Fix guidance — agents know HOW to resolve violations, not just WHAT is wrong (#642)
  - Path traversal containment check using path.relative prevents reads outside the project directory (#738)
  - Traversal skip now logs a warning via onWarn callback for visibility (#739)

## 1.3.4

### Patch Changes

- 98d56dc: ### Security & Compiler Hardening
  - `totem link` now requires explicit consent ("I understand") before creating cross-trust-boundary bridges. Bypass with `--yes` for CI/CD.
  - Shell orchestrator process termination uses process groups on Unix (prevents zombie processes)
  - SECURITY.md expanded with threat model, audit results, and Totem Mesh risks
  - Gate 1 (Proposal 184): Compiled rules now default to `severity: 'warning'` when LLM omits severity, preventing the #1 compiler regression
  - Added `severity` field to `CompilerOutputSchema`

## 1.3.3

## 1.3.2

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- ace02c0: ### Bug Fixes
  - **Critical:** Fixed filter ordering in `totem lint` and `totem shield` — ignored patterns (e.g., `.strategy` submodule) were checked after the emptiness test, preventing branch-diff fallback from firing. The Layer 3 pre-push gate was silently passing. (#709)
  - Fixed latent bug where AST rules with empty `pattern` fields could match every line when passed to the regex executor (#710)
  - Replaced 13 raw `throw new Error()` calls with typed `TotemError` subclasses across core and CLI packages (#711)

  ### Improvements
  - **Compiler facade refactor:** Split `compiler.ts` (600 lines) into focused modules — `compiler-schema.ts`, `diff-parser.ts`, `rule-engine.ts` — with `compiler.ts` as a clean coordinator. Public API unchanged. (#710)
  - Added `TOTEM_DEBUG=1` env var for full stack traces during troubleshooting (#711)
  - Added mandatory verify steps (lint + shield + verify_execution) to `totem spec` output (#708)
  - Reverted to curated 147-rule set and added 59 lesson hashes to nonCompilable blocklist (#708)

## 1.3.0

### Patch Changes

- a02f7f8: Release 1.3.0 — MCP verify_execution, spec inline invariants, baseline Fix guidance.

  ### Highlights
  - **MCP `verify_execution` tool**: AI agents can now mathematically verify their work before declaring a task done. Runs `totem lint` as a child process and returns pass/fail with violation details. Supports `staged_only` flag. Warns about unstaged changes.
  - **Spec inline invariant injection**: `totem spec` now outputs granular implementation tasks with Totem lessons injected directly into the steps where they apply. Closes the gap between "planning" and "doing."
  - **Baseline Fix suggestions**: 24 of 59 universal baseline lessons updated with explicit "Fix:" guidance. Every lesson now tells developers what TO do, not just what to avoid.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- baf6e15: Release 1.2.0 — ast-grep engine, compound rules, and shield CI hardening.

  ### Highlights
  - **ast-grep pattern engine**: Third rule engine alongside regex and Tree-sitter. Patterns look like source code (`process.env.$PROP`, `console.log($ARG)`) — dramatically easier for LLMs to generate accurately.
  - **ast-grep compound rules**: Full support for `has`/`inside`/`follows`/`not`/`all`/`any` operators via NapiConfig rule objects. Enables structural rules like "useEffect without cleanup."
  - **Shield CI hardening**: `shieldIgnorePatterns` now filters the diff before linting, preventing `.strategy` submodule pointer changes from triggering false CI failures.
  - **Dynamic import rules narrowed**: Code scanning alerts for dynamic imports in command files eliminated — rules now only apply to core/adapter code.
  - **Case-insensitive hash matching**: `totem explain` and `totem test --filter` now match regardless of case.
  - **README hardened**: Staff Engineer red team feedback addressed — deterministic enforcement, air-gapped operation, and git-committed artifacts all clarified.
  - **Docs injection scoped**: Manual content injection now targets README only, not all docs.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 4c0b2cd: Release 1.1.0 — Tier 2 AST engine, cross-totem queries, and totem explain.

  ### Highlights
  - **Tier 2 AST engine**: Compiled rules now support Tree-sitter S-expression queries alongside regex. Enables structural rule matching that regex alone can't express.
  - **Cross-totem queries**: New `linkedIndexes` config lets `totem spec` query knowledge from other totem-managed directories (e.g., strategy repos, design docs) alongside the primary project index.
  - **totem init --bare**: Zero-config initialization for non-code repositories — notes, docs, ADRs, infrastructure configs. No package.json required.
  - **totem explain**: Look up the full lesson behind any compiled rule violation. Supports partial hash prefix matching. Zero LLM, instant.
  - **TODO guardrail rules**: 3 new baseline rules catch `// TODO: implement` stubs, `throw new Error("Not implemented")`, and empty catch blocks. Baseline now ships 15 pre-compiled rules.
  - **Dimension mismatch detection**: `totem sync` writes `index-meta.json`. Switching embedding providers without rebuilding the index now throws a clear error instead of silently returning garbage results.
  - **Compiled rules reverted to curated set**: The 147 hand-audited rules are preserved. Blind recompilation with Flash produced regressions — compiler improvements tracked in #670.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- d49cdbf: Release 1.0.0 — Totem is production-ready.

  ### Highlights
  - **Zero-config lint protection**: `totem init` now ships 13 pre-compiled universal baseline rules. Every user gets deterministic lint protection from Day 1 — no API keys, no LLM calls required.
  - **Filesystem concurrency locks**: Sync and MCP mutations are now protected by PID-aware file locks with signal cleanup (SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP, SIGQUIT).
  - **Portability audit**: CLI help grouped by tier, `requireGhCli()` guard on GitHub commands, dynamic orchestrator detection, configurable bot markers, expanded issue URL regex for GitLab/self-hosted.
  - **TotemError consistency**: All error paths use structured `TotemError` hierarchy with recovery hints. Ollama model-not-found errors give actionable `ollama pull` instructions.
  - **MCP race condition fix**: `getContext()` uses promise memoization to prevent duplicate connections from concurrent callers, with retry on transient failures.
  - **Compiled rule audit**: 148 → 147 rules, 0 undefined severity, false positives on TotemError/type imports/stdlib imports eliminated.
  - **Manual docs survive regeneration**: `docs/manual/` content is injected verbatim into `totem docs` output.

## 0.44.0

### Minor Changes

- ab254bf: feat: migrate 54 throw sites to TotemError hierarchy

  Every error now includes a `recoveryHint` telling the user exactly how to fix it. New error classes: `TotemOrchestratorError`, `TotemGitError`. New error code: `GIT_FAILED`. Includes rule fix exempting error class imports from the static import lint rule.

## 0.43.0

## 0.42.0

### Minor Changes

- 557d046: feat: DLP secret masking — strip secrets before embedding (#534)

  Automatically masks API keys, tokens, passwords, and credentials with [REDACTED] before entering LanceDB. Preserves key names in assignments. Handles quoted and unquoted patterns.

  fix: compiler glob patterns — prompt constraints + brace expansion (#602)

  Compiler prompt now forbids unsupported glob syntax. Post-compile sanitizer expands brace patterns. Fixed 12 existing rules.

  fix: init embedding detection — Gemini first (#551)

  Reorders provider detection to prefer Gemini (task-type aware) over OpenAI when both keys present.

  fix: review blitz 2 — dynamic imports, onWarn, rule demotions (#575, #594, #595)

  compile.ts dynamic imports, loadCompiledRules onWarn callback, err.message rule demoted to warning.

  docs: Scope & Limitations section, Solo Dev Litmus Test styleguide rule

## 0.41.0

### Minor Changes

- 028786b: perf: cache non-compilable lessons to skip recompilation (#590)

  `totem compile` now caches lesson hashes that the LLM determined cannot be compiled. Subsequent runs skip them instantly. `totem wrap` goes from ~15 min to ~30 seconds.

  fix: remove duplicate compiled rule causing false positives (#589)

  Root cause was duplicate rules from compile, not a glob matching bug. Removed the broad duplicate.

  feat: auto-ingest cursor rules during totem init (#596)

  `totem init` scans for .cursorrules, .mdc, and .windsurfrules. If found, prompts user to compile them into deterministic invariants.

  fix: strip known-not-shipped issue refs from docs generation (#598)

  Ends the #515 hallucination that recurred in 5 consecutive releases. Pre-processing strips from git log, post-processing strips from LLM output.

## 0.40.0

### Minor Changes

- 99f8995: feat: .mdc / .cursorrules ingestion adapter (#555)

  New `totem compile --from-cursor` flag. Scans .cursor/rules/\*.mdc, .cursorrules, and .windsurfrules files. Parses frontmatter and plain text rules. Compiles them into deterministic Totem rules via the existing LLM pipeline.

  docs: README Holy Grail positioning (ADR-049)

  "A zero-config CLI that compiles your .cursorrules into deterministic CI guardrails. Stop repeating yourself to your AI." MCP as step 2, Solo Dev Superpower section, command table with speed metrics.

## 0.39.0

### Minor Changes

- dda8715: feat: shield severity levels — error vs warning (#498)

  Rules now support `severity: 'error' | 'warning'`. Errors block CI, warnings inform but pass. SARIF output maps severity to the `level` field. JSON output includes error/warning counts.

  chore: rule invariant audit — 137 rules categorized (#556)

  27 security (error), 56 architecture (error), 47 style (warning), 7 performance (warning). 39% reduction in hard blocks while maintaining all guidance.

  fix: auto-healing DB — dimension mismatch + version recovery (#500, #548)

  LanceStore.connect() auto-heals on embedder dimension mismatch and LanceDB version/corruption errors. Nukes .lancedb/ and reconnects empty for a clean rebuild.

## 0.38.0

### Minor Changes

- 89fcb02: feat: Trap Ledger Phase 1 — SARIF extension + enhanced totem stats

  Every `totem lint` violation now generates SARIF properties with eventId, ruleCategory, timestamp, and lessonHash. Rules support a `category` field (security/architecture/style/performance). `totem stats` shows "Total violations prevented" with category breakdown and top 10 prevented violations.

  fix: code review blitz — 7 findings from Claude+Gemini synthesis

  Critical: MCP loadEnv quote stripping, add_lesson race condition (promise memoization), SARIF format flag works with totem lint. High: extracted shared runCompiledRules (-75 lines), Gemini default model fixed, health check --rebuild → --full, lesson validation before disk write.

  fix: stale prompts — docs glossary, init model, reflex block v3

  Command glossary in docs system prompt prevents LLM confusing lint/shield. Gemini embedder model corrected in init. AI_PROMPT_BLOCK distinguishes lint (pre-push) from shield (pre-PR).

  chore: 137 compiled rules (39 new), 17 extracted lessons, docs sync

## 0.37.0

### Minor Changes

- 382c77a: feat: `totem lint` — new command for fast compiled rule checks (zero LLM)

  Split from `totem shield`. `totem lint` runs compiled rules against your diff in ~2 seconds with no API keys needed. `totem shield` is now exclusively the AI-powered code review. `--deterministic` flag is deprecated with a warning.

  feat: semantic rule observability (Phase 1)

  Rules now track `createdAt`, `triggerCount`, `suppressCount`, and `lastTriggeredAt` metadata. `totem stats` displays rule metrics. Foundation for automated rule decay analysis.

  fix: shield rule scoping — dynamic import and match/exec rules narrowed

  Dynamic import rule scoped to command files only (not adapters/orchestrators). match/exec rule scoped to security-sensitive code only. `.cjs` rule excludes CI workflow YAML.

## 0.36.0

### Minor Changes

- 74e521e: feat: graceful degradation for orchestrator and embedder providers

  Orchestrators (Gemini, Anthropic) now fall back to their CLI equivalents when the SDK or API key is missing. Embedders fall back to Ollama when the configured provider is unavailable. LazyEmbedder uses promise memoization to prevent race conditions with concurrent embed() calls.

  feat: configurable issue sources — support multiple repos in triage/extract/spec

  Add `repositories` field to `totem.config.ts`. When set, triage, audit, and spec commands aggregate issues from all listed repos. Supports `owner/repo#123` syntax for disambiguation.

  chore: switch default embedder to Gemini (gemini-embedding-2-preview)

  Task-type aware 768d embeddings replace OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (1536d). Requires `totem sync --full` after upgrade.

## 0.30.0

### Patch Changes

- d0be9c6: Add compile --export as Step 5 of totem wrap, exclude export targets from deterministic shield, throw NoLessonsError in compile command

## 0.29.0

### Patch Changes

- e311aff: Lesson injection into all orchestrator commands, totem audit, and Junie docs.
  - **`totem audit`** — strategic backlog audit with human approval gate, interactive multi-select, shell injection prevention via `--body-file`, resilient batch execution (#362)
  - **Lesson injection** — vector DB lessons now injected into shield (full bodies), triage (condensed), and briefing (condensed) via shared `partitionLessons()` + `formatLessonSection()` helpers (#370)
  - **Junie docs** — MCP config example and export target docs in README (#371)
  - **Lesson ContentType** — `add_lesson` MCP tool now uses `lesson` content type for better vector DB filtering (#377)
  - **Versioned reflex upgrade** — `REFLEX_VERSION=2` with `detectReflexStatus()` and `upgradeReflexes()` for existing consumers (#375)
  - **Spec lesson injection** — lessons injected as hard constraints into `totem spec` output (#366)

## 0.28.0

### Minor Changes

- d221d54: Extraction Hardening: semantic dedup for `totem extract`, dangling-tail heading cleanup, submodule-aware file resolver, and CLI `--help` fix.

## 0.27.0

### Minor Changes

- 20c912d: feat: saga validator for `totem docs` — deterministic post-update validation catches LLM hallucinations (checkbox mutations, sentinel corruption, frontmatter deletion, excessive content loss) before writing to disk (#356)

  fix: scope deterministic shield rules with fileGlobs — 21 of 24 compiled rules now have package-level glob scoping, preventing MCP-specific rules from firing against the entire codebase. Also fixes `matchesGlob` to support directory-prefixed patterns like `packages/cli/**/*.ts` (#357)

## 0.26.1

## 0.26.0

## 0.25.0

### Minor Changes

- 0455d24: Adversarial ingestion scrubbing, eval harness, Bun support, and model audit
  - **Adversarial ingestion scrubbing:** `sanitizeForIngestion()` strips BiDi overrides (Trojan Source defense) from all content types and invisible Unicode from prose chunks. Suspicious patterns flagged via `onWarn` but never stripped. Detection regexes consolidated into core for DRY reuse. XML tag regex hardened against whitespace bypass.
  - **Adversarial evaluation harness:** Integration tests with planted architectural violations for model drift detection. Deterministic tests run without API keys; LLM tests gated behind `CI_INTEGRATION=true` for nightly runs against Gemini, Anthropic, and OpenAI.
  - **Bun support:** `detectTotemPrefix()` checks for both `bun.lockb` (legacy) and `bun.lock` (Bun >= 1.2). Priority: pnpm > yarn > bun > npx.
  - **Model audit:** Updated default orchestrator model IDs — Anthropic to `claude-sonnet-4-6`, OpenAI to `gpt-5.4`/`gpt-5-mini`.
  - **Supported models doc:** New `docs/supported-models.md` with provider model listing APIs and discovery scripts.

## 0.24.0

### Patch Changes

- 3b8e53b: feat: git hook enforcement — block main commits + deterministic shield gate

  `totem init` now installs two enforcement hooks alongside the existing post-merge hook:
  - **pre-commit**: blocks direct commits to `main`/`master` (override with `git commit --no-verify`)
  - **pre-push**: runs `totem shield --deterministic` before push, bails instantly if no compiled rules exist (zero Node startup penalty for Lite tiers)

  Both hooks are idempotent, chain-friendly (append to existing hooks without clobbering), and cross-platform. Non-shell hooks (Node/Python) are detected and safely skipped.

  Also fixes truncated lesson headings — `generateLessonHeading` no longer appends ellipsis on truncation, and the extract prompt uses positive structural constraints for better LLM compliance.

## 0.23.0

### Minor Changes

- 83923f0: Add native Ollama orchestrator provider with dynamic `num_ctx` support
  - New `provider: 'ollama'` orchestrator config hits Ollama's native `/api/chat` endpoint directly via fetch (no SDK required)
  - Supports `numCtx` option to dynamically control context length and VRAM usage per-command
  - VRAM-friendly error messages on 500 errors suggest lowering `numCtx`
  - Connection errors suggest running `ollama serve`
  - Mirrors the existing `ollama-embedder` pattern (plain fetch, baseUrl defaulting)

## 0.22.0

### Minor Changes

- b3a07b8: ### 0.22.0 — AST Gating, OpenAI Orchestrator, Security Hardening

  **New Features**
  - **Tree-sitter AST gating** for deterministic shield — reduces false positives by classifying diff additions as code vs. non-code (#287)
  - **Generic OpenAI-compatible orchestrator** — supports OpenAI API, Ollama, LM Studio, and any OpenAI-compatible local server via BYOSD pattern (#285, #293)
  - **`totem handoff --lite`** — zero-LLM session snapshots with ANSI-sanitized git output (#281, #288)
  - **CI drift gate** with adversarial evaluation harness (#280)
  - **Concise lesson headings** — shorter, more searchable headings from extract (#271, #278)

  **Security Hardening**
  - Extract prompt injection hardening with explicit SECURITY NOTICE for untrusted PR fields (#279, #289, #295)
  - Path containment checks in drift detection to prevent directory traversal (#284)
  - ANSI terminal injection sanitization in handoff and git metadata (#292)

  **Bug Fixes**
  - GCA on-demand review configuration fixes (#278, #282)
  - GitHub Copilot lesson export confirmed working via existing `config.exports` (#294)

## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- e252d41: ### New Features
  - **`totem shield --mode=structural`** — Context-blind code review that catches syntax-level bugs (asymmetric validation, copy-paste drift, brittle tests, off-by-one errors) without Totem knowledge retrieval (#270)
  - **`totem compile --export`** — Cross-model lesson export via sentinel-based injection into AI assistant config files (#269)

  ### Improvements
  - Provider conformance suite with 15 tests and nightly smoke tests (#263)
  - CLA automation via `contributor-assistant/github-action` (#266)
  - Dependabot configured for security-only npm scanning and GitHub Actions version pinning (#272)

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- feat: discriminated union config and fileGlobs scoping
  - Extract shared orchestrator interface with discriminated union config schema
  - Add `fileGlobs` scoping for compiled shield rules

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- feat: async orchestrator and ReDoS protection
  - Refactored shell orchestrator from `execSync` to async `spawn` with streaming stdout/stderr, 50MB safety cap, and proper timeout handling (#206)
  - Added compile-time ReDoS static analysis via `safe-regex2` — vulnerable regex patterns are rejected during `totem compile` with diagnostic reasons (#218)
  - Graceful per-doc error handling in `totem docs` — a single doc failure no longer aborts the entire batch

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 03372b4: feat: drift detection for self-cleaning memory (#181)

  Adds `totem sync --prune` to detect and interactively remove lessons with stale file references. The drift detector scans `.totem/lessons.md` for backtick-wrapped file paths that no longer exist in the project, then presents an interactive multi-select for pruning. After pruning, the vector index is automatically re-synced.

  New core exports: `parseLessonsFile`, `extractFileReferences`, `detectDrift`, `rewriteLessonsFile`.
