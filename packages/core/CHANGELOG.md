### Patch Changes

- b7f298c: Ship the ADR-089 zero-trust default and the `totem rule promote` CLI (mmnto-ai/totem#1581, part 1 of 2).

  **Zero-trust default (core):** every LLM-generated rule now ships `unverified: true` unconditionally. Pipeline 2 (verify-retry loop) and Pipeline 3 (Bad/Good example-based) both flip from the pre-#1581 conditional behavior (keyed on Example Hit presence) to unconditional. Pipeline 1 (manual) keeps its pre-#1581 conditional semantics because manual rules are human-authored and self-evidencing; the existing Pipeline 1 Example-Hit guard stays as a safety net.

  Rationale: the LLM cannot self-certify structural invariants. Example Hit/Miss is an LLM-produced artifact of the compile process, not a human sign-off. Activation requires either human promotion via the new CLI below OR the ADR-091 Stage 4 Codebase Verifier in 1.16.0 (which validates rules empirically against actual code, not against LLM-generated snippet fixtures).

  **`totem rule promote <id>` CLI:** flips a rule's `unverified: true` flag to absent (canonical "verified" state), atomically refreshes `compile-manifest.json`'s `output_hash` so `verify-manifest` passes on the next push. Refuses to promote archived rules and refuses when the target rule is already verified. Exits 1 on ambiguous prefix matches with a disambiguation list.

  Hand-editing `compiled-rules.json` to flip `unverified` would break the manifest hash and trip the pre-push `verify-manifest` gate. The promote command is the blessed path; the atomic refresh closes that user trap at source.

  **Scope split:** the "Option 1 + Categorized Advisory" plan locks the 1.15.0 ship gate via this PR. The categorized `totem doctor` advisory that surfaces the 357 grandfathered pre-1.13.0 rules by reason lands as a follow-up PR on a separate branch to keep the reviewable surface tight.

  Closes #1581 (part 1).

- 358336e: Add `archivedAt` to `CompiledRuleBaseSchema` so Zod stops silently stripping it on round-trips (mmnto-ai/totem#1589).

  Pre-#1589, the schema declared `status`, `archivedReason`, `badExample`, `goodExample`, and a half-dozen other lifecycle fields — but not `archivedAt`. Zod's default behavior strips unknown keys during parse/serialize. Every compile-write cycle that round-tripped `compiled-rules.json` through `CompiledRulesFileSchema.parse()` silently erased prior `archivedAt` values from archived rules. Postmerge archive scripts (`scripts/archive-postmerge-*.cjs`) set the field via raw JSON mutation; it survived on disk until the next `totem lesson compile --export` quietly rewrote the file. Observed on PR #1588 (rule `4b091a1bc7d286d6`, archived 2026-04-19, timestamp lost during postmerge re-export). GCA caught the drop and we restored the timestamp manually; this ticket prevents future losses at the schema level.

  The field is declared `z.string().optional()` for backward compatibility with pre-#1589 manifests that never had the field populated. Existing call sites continue to work unchanged.

  Four new tests in `compiler-schema.test.ts` pin the invariant: accepts a rule with `archivedAt` set, preserves the field across a full parse → serialize → parse round-trip, tolerates an active rule without the field, and preserves the full archive tuple (`status` + `archivedReason` + `archivedAt`) together.

  Closes #1589.

## 1.14.15

### Patch Changes

- 89ca890: Extend the compile-time smoke gate with an over-matching check via `goodExample` (mmnto-ai/totem#1580).

  The gate now verifies both directions: the rule MUST match its `badExample` (under-matching check, in place since #1408) AND MUST NOT match its `goodExample` (over-matching check, new). A rule that fires on both sides is over-broad and produces false positives on every lint run, which was the dominant defect class observed in the 2026-04-18 security-pack postmerge incident (10-of-10 bad rate from #1526).

  `CompilerOutputSchema.goodExample` flips from optional to engine-conditional required for regex and ast-grep engines, mirroring the #1420 flip for `badExample`. The `ast` engine (Tree-sitter S-expression queries) remains exempt because the smoke gate does not yet evaluate those. `CompiledRuleSchema.goodExample` stays optional on the persisted-rule boundary for backward compat with pre-#1580 rules.

  Two new reason codes added to `NonCompilableReasonCodeSchema`: `matches-good-example` (over-match rejection) and `missing-goodexample` (defensive path for callers that bypass the schema refine). Rejected lessons surface in the `nonCompilable` ledger with the correct code so `totem doctor` and downstream telemetry can distinguish over-match rejections from other skip categories.

  Pipeline 3 automatically threads the lesson's Good snippet through as `goodExampleOverride`; Pipeline 2 requires the LLM to emit `goodExample` alongside `badExample` via the updated compiler prompt. Pipeline 1 (manual) is unaffected — the gate is opt-in via `enforceSmokeGate`.

  Closes #1580.

## 1.14.14

### Patch Changes

- e073dc0: Flip Pipeline 5 auto-capture on `totem review` from opt-out to opt-in.

  `--no-auto-capture` is renamed to `--auto-capture`; the default is now OFF. Observation rules captured from review findings are context-less (regex drawn from the flagged line, message taken from the reviewer, `fileGlobs` scoped to the whole codebase) and routinely pollute `compiled-rules.json` with rules that fire on unrelated files. The Liquid City Session 6 audit measured an 8-rule wave across 5 review invocations producing 13 new warnings on the next `totem lint`, up from 0.

  To preserve the old behavior, pass `--auto-capture` explicitly. Auto-capture will resume as a default once ADR-091 Stage 2 Classifier + Stage 4 Codebase Verifier ship in 1.16.0 and the LLM-emitted rule loop has gates that prevent context-less emissions.

  Closes #1579.

## 1.14.13

### Patch Changes

- 8dd8dc8: core: thread per-invocation `RuleEngineContext` through the rule engine

  Removes the module-level `let coreLogger` / `let shieldContextDeprecationWarned` state from `rule-engine.ts` and replaces the hidden DI setter (`setCoreLogger` / `resetShieldContextWarning`) with a required `RuleEngineContext` parameter on `applyRulesToAdditions`, `applyAstRulesToAdditions`, `applyRules`, and `extractJustification`. Concurrent or federated rule evaluations cannot bleed logger wiring or deprecation-warning latching across each other. Closes mmnto-ai/totem#1441.

  **Breaking:** `setCoreLogger` and `resetShieldContextWarning` are removed from `@mmnto/totem`. Callers must build a `RuleEngineContext` once per linting invocation and pass it as the first argument to the affected functions. See the README or the `RuleEngineContext` JSDoc for the shape.

## 1.14.12

### Patch Changes

- dad363b: ADR-088 Phase 1 Layer 4 substrate: compile --verbose trace + doctor stale-rule advisory.

  `totem compile --verbose` emits a structured per-lesson layer-trace block
  that shows which pipeline the lesson took, the generated pattern hash,
  verify outcome, retry scheduling, and the terminal result plus reasonCode
  on skip. Output ships via a single `process.stdout.write` per lesson so
  concurrent compiles do not interleave within a block. The trace is
  produced unconditionally on `CompileLessonResult.trace` across all three
  pipelines (layer 1 manual, layer 2 example-based, layer 3 Layer 3 LLM
  with verify-retry); callers that do not pass `--verbose` pay only the
  cost of a small per-lesson array.

  `RuleMetric` gains an `evaluationCount` field. `runCompiledRules`
  increments it exactly once per rule per lint run, regardless of how many
  matches fire. Pre-#1483 rule-metrics.json files load with the new field
  defaulted to zero via Zod, so the migration is transparent.

  `totem doctor` adds a stale-rule advisory that flags active rules whose
  cumulative `evaluationCount` has crossed a configurable window while
  `contextCounts.code` stayed at zero. Security rules (category=security
  OR immutable=true) land with a higher-severity label and the advisory
  declines to recommend archival for them; standard rules get both
  `totem compile --upgrade <hash>` and archival as recovery paths.
  `TotemConfig.doctor.staleRuleWindow` (default 10) gates the check. v1
  uses cumulative-lifetime semantics; #1550 tracks the rolling-window
  upgrade via `RuleMetric.runHistory` ring buffer, behind the same config
  key so no user migration is needed.

  Advisory only: no auto-archive, no mutation to the rules file. The
  existing `totem doctor --pr` autonomous minAgeDays GC path is untouched.

  Closes #1482. Closes #1483.

- 1107f24: ADR-088 Phase 1 Layers 3 and 4 substrate: unverified flag and reason codes.

  `CompiledRule` gains an optional `unverified: boolean` field, set to `true`
  when the rule was compiled from a lesson lacking a non-empty Example Hit
  block. Pipeline 1 (manual), Pipeline 2 (LLM), and Pipeline 3 (example-based)
  all flag the rule rather than shipping a pattern with no ground truth.
  Security-scoped lessons (`deps.securityContext === true` or a manual rule
  with `immutable: true`) reject outright instead of flagging, per the
  Decision 3 zero-tolerance policy. Absence of the field preserves pre-#1480
  manifest hashes via `canonicalStringify`; the literal `false` is never
  written.

  The `nonCompilable` ledger upgrades from `{hash, title}` to the 4-tuple
  `{hash, title, reasonCode, reason?}`. `reasonCode` is one of
  `no-pattern-generated`, `pattern-syntax-invalid`, `pattern-zero-match`,
  `verify-retry-exhausted`, `security-rule-rejected`, `no-pattern-found`,
  `out-of-scope`, `missing-badexample`, or `legacy-unknown`. The loader
  accepts all three historical shapes (string, 2-tuple, 4-tuple) and
  normalizes legacy rows to `reasonCode: 'legacy-unknown'`; the writer
  enforces the 4-tuple via a strict `NonCompilableEntryWriteSchema`.
  `saveCompiledRulesFile` validates every entry before serialization and
  throws on schema mismatch, following the lesson 400fed87 Read/Write
  invariant.

  Pipeline 2 validator rejections (invalid regex, unparseable ast-grep) and
  LLM-response parse failures move from the `failed` bucket to `skipped`
  with an explicit reasonCode so ADR-088 Layer 4 telemetry sees every
  outcome. `compile.ts` `nonCompilableMap` now carries the full 4-tuple
  through the run, and `install.ts` pack-merge routes writes through
  `saveCompiledRulesFile` so pack installs also go through the Write
  schema gate.

  Closes #1480. Closes #1481.

## 1.14.11

### Patch Changes

- fc0d367: Config-driven source-extension list for the review content hash.

  Polyglot repos can now override the historical `['.ts', '.tsx', '.js', '.jsx']` set by declaring `review.sourceExtensions` in `totem.config.ts`. The CLI writes the validated set to `.totem/review-extensions.txt` on every `totem sync`, and `.claude/hooks/content-hash.sh` reads it so both implementations stay in lockstep. Defaults are unchanged; consumers who do not set the field see no behavior difference. Closes #1527 and #1529.

## 1.14.10

### Patch Changes

- 84bba42: Pipeline 1 compound rule authoring + first three production compound rules + fail-loud git.ts / rule-engine.ts

  **Pipeline 1 compound extension (new capability).** `extractManualPattern` now accepts a yaml-tagged fenced code block following the `**Pattern:**` field marker in a lesson body. The parsed NapiConfig object routes through `buildManualRule` into the `astGrepYamlRule` field on the compiled rule (same path the LLM-driven Pipeline 2 uses). Pack authors no longer need Sonnet in the loop to hand-author compound rules with `inside` / `has` / `not` combinators.

  New export from `@mmnto/totem`: `extractYamlRuleAfterField(body, field)`. Accepts both `yaml`-tagged triple-backtick and tilde-fence styles. The scan stops at the next bold-field marker or EOF, so subsequent sections (`**Message:**`, `### Bad Example`, narrative prose) live freely. Bare untagged fences are ignored, so prose code blocks below the pattern pass through.

  **Three inaugural compound rules shipped** (all manual Pipeline 1, first production compound rules in the manifest):
  - `Ban fail-open catch blocks that swallow errors without re-throwing` — matches `catch_clause` where the body subtree has no `throw_statement`. Compound form: `rule.kind: catch_clause, not.has.throw_statement (stopBy: end)`. The escape hatch is `// totem-ignore-next-line` above the offending catch for genuine best-effort cleanup.
  - `` Ban `spawn()` / `spawnSync()` with `shell: true` `` — `any:` disjunction over the two call names plus `has:` descendant check on a `shell: true` pair. Scope-excludes `packages/cli/src/orchestrators/shell-orchestrator.ts` (the single legitimate `shell: true` site, secured by `MODEL_NAME_RE` and `quoteShellArg` in 1.14.10).
  - ``Ban `export let` declarations (exported module-level mutable state)`` — targets `export_statement` with a `lexical_declaration` child matching `let`. Zero current violations; forward protection ahead of 1.15.0 Pack Distribution.

  **Fail-loud audit fixes (closes mmnto/totem#1440 and mmnto/totem#1442).**
  - `isFileDirty(cwd, filePath)` — previously returned `false` on any git failure. Now throws `TotemGitError` on non-ENOENT git failures so callers like `docs` (data-loss-protection filter) cannot mistake "git broke" for "file is clean." Pure ENOENT "git missing" still routes through the existing `throwIfGitMissing` helper.
  - `resolveGitRoot(cwd)` — previously returned `null` on any git failure, conflating "not in a git repo" (legitimate) with "git broken" (bug). Now returns `null` only when the error message matches `/not a git repository/i`; other failures throw. The `string | null` contract is preserved for the one documented case.
  - `applyRulesToAdditions` (regex engine) — previously swallowed invalid-regex errors with `continue`, so a corrupted manifest entry would mark the diff "compliant" with a load-bearing rule mute. Now throws `TotemParseError` naming the rule's lesson hash in the message (with the offending pattern quoted in the recovery hint), so the operator sees exactly which rule to fix or archive.

  Cosmetic git helpers that legitimately fall back to display strings (`getGitBranch`, `getGitStatus`, `getGitDiffStat`, `getTagDate`, `getLatestTag`, `getGitLogSince`) keep their silent-fallback behavior but now carry `// totem-ignore` comments documenting the exception. The intermediate `getDefaultBranch` probe-loop catch is also marked with `// totem-ignore` (the outer function throws if every candidate fails — intentional control flow).

  **Tests:** +11 in `lesson-pattern.test.ts` for the yaml-fence extractor, +0 net in `git.test.ts` and `compiler.test.ts` (two existing tests were updated to assert the new throw behavior, with issue references in the test names).

  Thanks to Gemini for the pre-1.15.0 deep review audit (mmnto/totem#1421) that surfaced both #1440 and #1442 and drafted the three compound rule YAML shapes.

- 6776b11: Security: Reject shell-injecting `{model}` tokens in the shell orchestrator

  The shell orchestrator used to interpolate `orchestrator.defaultModel` (and per-command overrides) directly into a command string that was then executed with `shell: true`. A poisoned config value like `"gemini-1.5; rm -rf /"` would run as shell. The `{file}` token was already shell-quoted; the `{model}` token was not.

  **Fix is defense in depth:**
  1. **Shared allow-list at the boundary.** The shell orchestrator now imports `MODEL_NAME_RE` from `orchestrator.ts` and applies the same leading-dash + allow-list check that `resolveOrchestrator` has always used. Single source of truth for model-name validation, symmetric across all orchestrators, no chance of one gate rejecting what another accepts. Validation errors throw `TotemConfigError` matching the sibling validator.
  2. **Shell-quoting at interpolation.** Even after the allow-list passes, the model token is wrapped in shell-safe quotes (single-quote on Unix, MSVCRT-style `\"` escape on Windows) — same treatment the `{file}` token has always had. A future regression that drops the allow-list cannot re-open the hole alone.

  **Regression tests added:** 12 exploit cases (semicolon, backtick, dollar-subshell, pipe, redirect, newline, ampersand, space, quote, dquote, paren, leading-dash) all rejected before `spawn()` is called. 8 benign model shapes accepted including underscore-containing ollama quantized tags. 1 defense-in-depth assertion that the model is quoted on the spawn command.

  **Exposure assessment:**

  Exploitable only when a user runs any `totem` command that reaches the shell orchestrator AND a poisoned `totem.config.ts` is present. Realistic vector: cloning a malicious repo and running `totem review` / `totem compile` / `totem spec` against it. Trusted-config users (single-developer, audited-config repos) were never at risk.

  **Minor backward-compat note:**

  Users whose `orchestrator.command` string manually wrapped `{model}` in quotes (e.g., `"--model=\"{model}\""`) will see the token double-quoted after this patch. The shell strips the outer quotes, so the final argv is identical, but if anyone has a custom command that depends on the raw unquoted substitution, they should drop the manual quotes from their template. Most users followed the existing `{file}` pattern (no manual quotes — Totem quotes for you), so this affects a narrow slice.

  Thanks to Gemini for catching this in the pre-1.15.0 deep review.

## 1.14.9

### Patch Changes

- e96599e: Precision Engine: compound ast-grep rules + compile-time smoke gate

  The 1.14.9 release closes the rule-quality loop before Pack Distribution opens. Compiled rules can now express structural context ("inside a loop", "outside an import"), and every Pipeline 2 / Pipeline 3 rule must demonstrably match its own `badExample` snippet before it lands in `compiled-rules.json`. Defense-in-Depth Layer 2: the schema rejects malformed shapes at parse time; the smoke gate rejects semantically-broken rules at compile time.

  **Compound ast-grep rules (#1410, #1412):**
  - New `astGrepYamlRule` field on `CompiledRule` carries full `NapiConfig`-shape compound rules with `inside`, `has`, and `not` combinators. Mutually exclusive with the flat `astGrepPattern` field via Zod `superRefine`.
  - New `canonicalStringify` utility in `compile-manifest.ts` produces key-order-deterministic hashes so compound rules with semantically-identical shapes but different LLM key orders cannot trip `verify-manifest`. Backward-compat guard: pre-1.14.9 manifests without compound rules hash byte-for-byte to the same value as before, so existing installs do not need a forced recompile.
  - Spike harness committed under `packages/core/spikes/compound-ast-grep/` with 9 tests pinning the empirically-validated behaviors of `@ast-grep/napi@0.42.0`, including the sharp edge that `inside: { pattern: 'for ($A; $B; $C) { $$$ }' }` silently matches zero (use `inside: { kind: 'for_statement' }` instead).

  **Engine runtime + compile-time smoke gate (#1415):**
  - `applyAstRulesToAdditions` widened to dispatch on either `astGrepPattern` (string) or `astGrepYamlRule` (object), with per-rule try/catch in `executeQuery` so one malformed rule cannot crash a whole file's lint pass.
  - New `'failure'` event variant on `RuleEventCallback`, semantically distinct from `'suppress'` (suppression is reserved for user-initiated `totem-ignore` directives). Failure context carries `failureReason` for `totem doctor` aggregation.
  - New `compile-smoke-gate.ts` module exports `runSmokeGate(rule, badExample)`. Reuses the runtime engine entry points (`matchAstGrepPattern`, `new RegExp`) so a rule passing the gate cannot silently fail to match at runtime on identical input. Multi-extension iteration so rules scoped to both `.js` and `.jsx` (which map to different parsers) match under whichever parser the snippet needs.

  **Compiler prompt + `badExample` requirement (#1420):**
  - Pipeline 2 and Pipeline 3 compiler prompts rewritten to teach Sonnet compound rule emission with `kind:` for outer combinator targets. Three compound examples (inside-a-for-loop, has-shell-true, JSON.parse-not-in-try) each carrying their own `badExample`.
  - New `KIND_ALLOW_LIST` named export from `compile-templates.ts`. 15 tree-sitter kinds covering common outer-combinator surfaces (control flow, function and class declarations, imports/exports, if/switch). Reusable: `totem doctor` will lint existing compiled rules for illegal `kind:` targets in a future release.
  - `CompilerOutputSchema.badExample` flipped from optional to required for `ast-grep` AND `regex` engines via `superRefine`. The `ast` (Tree-sitter) engine stays exempt because the smoke gate does not yet cover S-expression queries. Pipeline 1 (manual) gate enforcement is deferred to #1414 pending a 136-lesson Bad Example backfill.

  **Architectural impact:**

  Pipeline 2 compile throughput dropped to near zero between #1415 and #1420 because the gate started rejecting rules before the prompt had taught Sonnet to emit `badExample`. This was the gate working as designed: better zero rules than zero-match hallucinations distributed via packs. The prompt rewrite in #1420 reopens the throughput valve. Phase 4 of the epic (batch-recompile of 22+ archived rules tagged `upgradeTarget: compound`) unblocks once the new prompt is exercised against the queue.

  **Test counts:** 2879 passing across core (1134), CLI (1662), MCP (83). Net +93 from the 1.14.8 baseline of 2786.

  **Compiled rules:** 411 in the rules array (389 active, 22 archived). 889 nonCompilable entries in the sibling ledger (lessons the LLM declined to convert into rules).

  **Follow-ups (unmilestoned):** #1414 (Pipeline 1 backfill), #1418 (MCP stale-handle), #1419 (Trap Ledger crypto attestation for SOX). The pre-1.15.0 deep review gate (#1421) blocks 1.15.0 implementation until a four-surface independent pass on `main` clears.

## 1.14.8

### Patch Changes

- bcc9c72: Perf Follow-up: batch compile upgrades and cwd threading

  **Perf / correctness (#1232, #1235):**
  - Thread explicit `cwd` through `compileCommand` (#1232). `runSelfHealing(cwd)` was ignoring its own cwd parameter because `compileCommand` read `process.cwd()` directly. Fixed by adding `cwd?: string` to `CompileOptions` and threading it to the call site. Prevents future divergence if doctor gains `--cwd`.
  - Batch `--upgrade` hashes in `runSelfHealing` (#1235). Previously N upgrade candidates meant N full config/lessons/rules/metrics load cycles. Now all telemetry prefixes build in one metrics load and `compileCommand({ upgradeBatch, cwd })` runs once. Unresolved batch hashes now throw `UPGRADE_HASH_NOT_FOUND` instead of silently becoming 'noop' and masking compile-prune mutations. CLI `--upgrade <hash>` flow is backwards compatible.

  **Governance:**
  - Added `.github/pull_request_template.md` enforcing Mechanical Root Cause, Fix Applied, Out of Scope, Tests, and Related Tickets sections. Feeds downstream tooling (changesets, CR/GCA context extraction) with consistent structure.

  **Postmerge:** 7 new lessons extracted, 1 rule compiled and archived for over-breadth (upgradeTarget: compound per Proposal 226).

## 1.14.7

### Patch Changes

- cb51b59: Nervous System Capstone: mesh completion and tactical cleanup

  **Mesh completion (#1307, #1308):**
  - `totem search` now federates queries across `linkedIndexes`. Results merge by score with `[linkName]` prefix for linked hits. Dimension mismatch guard and global maxResults cap included. Connection and search failures degrade gracefully with warnings.
  - `totem doctor` gains a "Linked Indexes" health check. Validates each configured linked index: path exists, `.lancedb` present, config present, embedding provider present, no name collisions.

  **Tactical cleanup (#1391, #1350, #1354, #1357):**
  - Codified PR review bot reply protocol (CR vs GCA) in contributing docs, gemini styleguide, and CLAUDE.md.
  - Added `NO_LESSONS_DIR` guard before both `generateInputHash` calls in compile command.
  - Extracted duplicated `ok()`/`fail()` spawn mock helpers to shared `test-utils.ts`.
  - Added `describeSafeExecError` helper and migrated `safeExec` callers to walk cause chains (rule 102 compliance). Removed message concatenation from `wrapSpawnError`.

  **Postmerge:** 7 new lessons, 2 new compiled rules (1 archived for over-breadth).

## 1.14.6

### Patch Changes

- 6b58563: Quality sweep Phase 1-2 and voice compliance fixes

  **Voice compliance (3 PRs):**
  - Reconcile lesson heading separator lint rules with parser flexibility (#1379, closes #1374). The compiler had produced a broken negative lookahead (`(?! .+[chars] .+)` instead of `(?! [chars] .+)`); hand-corrected.
  - Strip em dashes from `totem lint` verdict and violation output (#1382, closes #1373). Updated README code-fence examples to match.
  - Rename deprecated bare `totem extract` heading in cli-reference.md to canonical `totem lesson extract` (#1383, closes #1377).

  **Quality sweep Phase 1 (#1387, closes #1380, #1352, #1355):**
  - Archive 5 over-broad compiled rules and retire 1 duplicate lesson.

  **Quality sweep Phase 2:**
  - Escape glob wildcards (`*`) and underscores (`_`) in the export markdown renderer to prevent emphasis corruption in copilot/junie instruction files (#1388, closes #1386).
  - Archive 2 over-broad `throw $ERR` rules that need compound `inside: catch` ast-grep constraints (#1389, closes #1218). Tagged with `upgradeTarget: compound` per Proposal 226.

  **Postmerge (2 PRs):**
  - 31 new lessons extracted from the 1.14.3-1.14.5 afternoon marathon and voice scrub PRs (#1384, #1385). 3 rules compiled (1 kept, 2 archived for over-breadth).

## 1.14.5

### Patch Changes

- bd63810: Replace `execFileSync` with `cross-spawn.sync` in `safeExec` to close the Windows shell-injection vector (#1329)

  `safeExec` previously set `shell: IS_WIN` on its `execFileSync` call so that Windows `.cmd` and `.bat` shims (`git.cmd`, `npx.cmd`, etc.) could resolve without ENOENT errors. The side effect was that `cmd.exe` interpreted shell metacharacters (`&`, `|`, `>`, `"`, and so on) in argument values, creating both a correctness bug (see mmnto/totem#1233 for the stray `{}` file that appeared when `cmd.exe` parsed the arrow-function `=>` as `=` plus `>`) and a shell-injection surface for any caller that forwarded untrusted input through `safeExec`. 57 call sites across 16 files were at risk.

  The fix swaps the underlying primitive from Node's native `child_process.execFileSync` to `cross-spawn.sync`. `cross-spawn` handles Windows `.cmd` and `.bat` shim resolution internally without ever enabling `shell: true` at the Node layer, so shim resolution still works while shell metacharacters in argument values now pass through verbatim on all platforms. The public `safeExec(command, args, options): string` signature is unchanged, the throw-on-non-zero-exit contract is preserved, the `.cause` chain is preserved, and the existing `maxBuffer`, `timeout`, `trim`, and `stdin input` options behave identically.

  One additive extension to the error shape: the thrown Error on any failure path now exposes optional `.status`, `.signal`, `.stdout`, and `.stderr` fields matching the richer `SpawnSyncReturns` shape that `cross-spawn` provides. The `.stdout` and `.stderr` fields preserve raw subprocess output (trailing whitespace included) so callers see the unmodified bytes. Message formatting uses trimmed copies internally. Callers that only read `.message` and `.cause` (the pre-#1329 contract) continue to work unchanged. Callers that want to distinguish exit codes no longer have to parse the message body. A new test `exposes .status on the thrown error for non-zero exit codes` locks this in, and the `SafeExecErrorFields` interface is exported from `@mmnto/totem` so downstream packages can type-narrow without falling back to `any`.

  Test invariants locked in (3 new, all invariants from the #1329 design doc):
  1. Shell metacharacters in argument values pass through verbatim on all platforms (headline regression test, uses `hello&world>bar` as the canonical dangerous argument).
  2. Pipes and double quotes in argument values pass through verbatim (second metacharacter set covering `|` and `"`).
  3. Non-zero exit codes are exposed on the thrown Error via `.status`.

  Existing invariants (all 7 from the design doc) continue to pass after the refactor: throw-on-non-zero-exit, `.cause` chain, throw-on-command-not-found, timeout kill plus throw, trim default and override, and Windows `.cmd` shim resolution (indirectly verified via the existing `node` command resolution tests, which work via the same cross-spawn path).

## 1.14.4

### Patch Changes

- 55a7e19: Add parser-based semantic validation to `validateAstGrepPattern` (#1339)

  The pre-#1339 validator used a heuristic brace/paren depth tracker that caught obvious multi-root patterns (`;` or `\n` at depth 0) but missed single-line patterns that ast-grep still rejects as "Multiple AST nodes are detected" at runtime. The canonical failure from the 1.14.1 postmerge compile was `.option("--no-$FLAG", $$$REST)` — a floating member call with no receiver. The pattern has balanced parens, no statement separators, one visible "expression", and sails through the heuristic. ast-grep's actual rule compiler rejects it because `.option(...)` isn't a valid AST root node without a receiver. Result: the broken rule landed in `compiled-rules.json`, and every PR rebased on main that touched any `.ts` file crashed `totem lint` until someone manually deleted the rule.

  The fix keeps the existing heuristic as a fast-path (good error messages for the common cases) and adds a second layer that invokes ast-grep's actual rule compiler via `parse(Lang.Tsx, '').root().findAll(pattern)`. If ast-grep cannot compile the pattern into a single-rooted rule, the error surfaces at compile time instead of at runtime. The Tsx language is the most permissive parser (superset of TypeScript plus JSX), so any valid JS/TS/JSX/TSX pattern should pass. Empty source keeps the call cheap — ast-grep compiles the pattern into a rule object before iterating any AST, so rule-compile errors surface even against nothing to match.

  Also catches the latent `catch($E) { $$$ }` bug: bare catch clauses look valid to the heuristic but ast-grep rejects them because they can only exist as children of a try statement. The pre-existing test that asserted this pattern was valid was aspirational — no production rule ever used it (the compile gate nudged real rules into try-wrapped forms like `try { $$$BODY } catch ($ERR) {}`), so the bug never surfaced in shipped rules, but it would have on the first rule that tried.

  Lite-build safety: `validateAstGrepPattern` is only called from compile flows (`buildCompiledRule` / `buildManualRule`), which require an orchestrator and therefore never run in the Lite binary. The esbuild alias swaps `@ast-grep/napi` for the WASM shim in Lite builds, but since this function is dead code there, the shim's `ensureInit()` requirement is never triggered. The parser call is additionally wrapped in try/catch so any surprise error degrades conservatively to `valid: false` rather than crashing.

  Audit: all 203 production ast-grep rules in `.totem/compiled-rules.json` parse cleanly through the new check. No rule regressions.

## 1.14.3

### Patch Changes

- 0b3e274: Filter `status: 'archived'` rules out of `loadCompiledRules` (#1336)

  `loadCompiledRules` previously returned every rule in `compiled-rules.json` regardless of lifecycle state. The schema had the `status: 'active' | 'archived'` field since the `totem doctor --pr` GC phase shipped, the doc comment on the schema literally said "active rules are enforced, archived rules are skipped", and the `totem doctor --pr` self-healing loop mutated stale rules to `status: 'archived'` with an `archivedReason` — but nothing in the lint execution path actually filtered them out. The self-healing loop was a placebo: archiving a rule via `totem doctor` left it firing in the linter. The only way to truly silence a rule was to delete it from the JSON.

  `loadCompiledRules` now applies `parsed.rules.filter((r) => r.status !== 'archived')` before returning. Legacy rules without a `status` field stay enabled (using `!== 'archived'` rather than `=== 'active'` so undefined is treated as active). `loadCompiledRulesFile` remains unfiltered so admin consumers (`totem doctor`, `totem compile`, `totem import`) can still read archived entries for lifecycle management and telemetry persistence — archiving is not deletion; the rule stays in the manifest.

  Effect: `totem doctor --pr` archive path now works as documented. Archived rules no longer produce violations during `totem lint`, `totem review`, or `runRuleTests`. No config migration required.

## 1.14.2

## 1.14.1

### Patch Changes

- b76128e: 1.14.1 — Hotfix sweep (#1311)

  Bundled fixes for four post-1.14.0 regressions surfaced during the first day of 1.14.0 in production:
  - **#1304** — `totem review` and `totem lint` were running rules against on-disk content instead of staged content when files had unstaged modifications. The rule engine now loads staged blob content via `git show :path` when a path is in the index, and reads from the filesystem only when the path is unstaged. Path containment is also hardened to reject symlinks that escape the repo root.
  - **#1305** — `lance-search` predicates were failing on any field name containing a SQL keyword or dash (`source-repo`, `file-type`) because the generated `WHERE` clause lacked backtick quoting. Field identifiers are now backtick-wrapped consistently.
  - **#1306** — AST engine test coverage audit found an uncovered branch in `ast-query` that silently returned an empty result set for malformed tree-sitter query strings. It now throws a descriptive error so `totem compile` can surface the broken rule instead of silently dropping it.
  - **#1309** — `totem doctor` and `totem lint` were still printing the legacy `totem review --fix` hint after that flag was removed in 1.12. Updated to the current `totem review --apply` form.

- b76128e: Reject nonsense Pipeline 5 observation rules (#1324)

  Pipeline 5 (auto-capture from Shield findings) was faithfully converting every source line Shield flagged into an observation rule, including lines that were pure syntactic noise (`}`, `*/`, bare braces) or comment-only. The result was a steady drip of garbage rules that users had to clean up via `git checkout -- .totem/compiled-rules.json` after every `totem review`.

  `generateObservationRule()` now rejects source lines with fewer than 3 alphanumeric characters and lines that are entirely comments (JSDoc, block-comment continuation, line comments, bare hash). The check is deliberately minimal — the goal is to drop obvious noise, not to second-guess Shield's judgment on real code.

  Closes #1279. Three consecutive reproductions (`*/`, `}`, and PR #1292's own cascade-fix commits) blocked on this gate in testing.

- b76128e: Support tilde-fenced code blocks in lessons and compiler output (#1326)

  CommonMark allows `~~~` as an alternate code-fence delimiter. Totem's lesson parser, compiler-response parser, drift detector, lesson linter, and suspicious-lesson detector were all hard-coded to recognize only triple-backtick fences, so any lesson authored with tilde fences silently lost its code blocks during extraction and compilation.

  Seven files updated to match both fence styles. Every regex uses a capture group plus backreference for the opening delimiter, so opening and closing fences must match — mixing fence styles in a single block won't cross-match and produce garbage captures.

## 1.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 11ab03b: 1.14.0 — The Nervous System Foundation

  Cross-repo federated context (shipped as the headline feature) plus opt-in preview of persistent LLM context caching. Mesh and caching are two halves of the same nervous system — sharing context across space (cross-repo federation) and across time (cached tokens) — but they ship at different maturity levels in 1.14.0: mesh is the active default, caching is opt-in preview machinery whose default activation is tracked for 1.15.0 in mmnto/totem#1291.
  - **Cross-Repo Context Mesh (#1295):** New `linkedIndexes: []` option in `totem.config.ts` lets a repo federate semantic search against sibling Totem-managed repos. `SearchResult` now includes source context fields (`sourceRepo`, `absoluteFilePath`) so agents can Read/Edit results unambiguously regardless of which repo the hit came from. Federation merges results via cross-store Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF k=60) rather than raw score comparison, eliminating the score-scale bias that would otherwise pin one store's results below another's when their underlying search methods produce scores in incompatible ranges (hybrid RRF ~0.03 vs vector-only ~0.85). A healthy primary + one broken linked store returns partial results with a per-query runtime warning; an entire-federation outage returns `isError: true` instead of masking as "no results found." Per-store reconnect+retry recovers from stale handles during concurrent `totem sync` rebuilds. Targeted `boundary: "<name>"` queries route only to that linked store. Strategy Proposal 215.
  - **LLM Context Caching — Opt-In Preview (#1292):** Anthropic `cache_control` markers wired through the orchestrator middleware for compile + review paths. Sliding TTL configurable via `cacheTTL`, constrained to the two values Anthropic supports natively: `300` (5 minutes, default ephemeral) or `3600` (1 hour, extended cache). The TTL resets on every cache hit, so bulk recompile runs stay warm end-to-end as long as operations land inside the active window. **Defaults to off in 1.14.0** — opt-in via `enableContextCaching: true` in `totem.config.ts` to avoid surprising existing users mid-cycle with a token-usage profile shift. Default activation tracked for 1.15.0 in mmnto/totem#1291. Anthropic-only in this release; Gemini `CachedContent` support tracked for 1.16.0+. Strategy Proposal 217. The full machinery (orchestrator middleware, schema field, TTL-literal validation, per-call cache metric tracking) ships in 1.14.0 — only the default-on behavior is deferred.
  - **Federation diagnostic hardening:** Dimension-mismatch diagnostic now persists across queries (one-shot is wrong when the underlying state is actively blocking — a single warning followed by cryptic LanceDB errors was worse than a persistent actionable message). One-shot first-query flags are only consumed after the gated operation actually succeeds, so transient `getContext` failures don't permanently suppress startup warnings. Linked-store init warnings (empty stores, name collisions, dimension mismatches) survive reconnect cycles intact — they represent static config state that a runtime reconnect can't fix.
  - **Collision-safe state:** Linked store name collisions (two paths deriving to the same basename) are keyed under the bare derived name in `linkedStoreInitErrors` so the `performSearch` boundary lookup can find them — earlier revisions used a descriptive composite key that was unreachable by any user-facing query. Primary store failures are tracked in a dedicated `FailureLog.primary` slot rather than overloading `'primary'` as a map key, which would have collided with legal link names (`deriveLinkName` strips leading dots, so a linked repo at `.primary/` derives to `'primary'`).
  - **Smoke test (#1295 Phase 3):** Standalone CLI integration test (`packages/mcp/dist/smoke-test.js`) exercises a real `ServerContext` against the current `totem.config.ts`, runs a federated query across primary + all linked stores, and emits a pass/fail verdict with per-store hit counts and top-N formatted results. Used as the empirical proof for the PR #1295 body; repurposable for any future cross-repo validation.
  - **19 lessons extracted** from the 1.14.0 PR arc (#1292, #1295, #1296); 1 new compiled rule via local Sonnet (394 total, up from 393). 18 lessons skipped as architectural/conceptual — tracked as `nonCompilable` tuples for doctor triage. Most of the architectural 1.14.0 learnings (silent-drift anti-patterns, reserved-key collisions, session-vs-per-request state confusion, failure-modes-table-as-design-review-tool) are non-compilable by nature but live in `.totem/lessons/` as referenceable architectural patterns. (The initial compile pass produced 2 rules; the delimiter-cache-key rule was reframed as architectural after both bots caught a malformed ast-grep pattern that the LLM produced twice in a row — Tenet 4 says broken rules should not ship, so the lesson now lives as documentation only.)
  - **2722 tests** across core + cli + mcp (up from 2580 at the start of the 1.14.0 cycle).

## 1.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 0b08629: 1.13.0 — The Refinement Engine

  Telemetry-driven rule refinement, compilation routing through Claude Sonnet 4.6, and structural pattern upgrades. The compile pipeline now generates high-fidelity rules at scale (393 precise rules, 203 ast-grep / 190 regex), and the doctor diagnostic closes the loop on noisy ones.
  - **Sonnet routing (#1220):** Compile pipeline routes through `anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6` instead of Gemini. Strategy #73 benchmark across 30 lessons in 4 difficulty tiers proved Sonnet wins on every metric — 90% correctness vs Gemini Pro's 73%, 2.4s vs 19.6s avg. The compiler system prompt was rewritten with explicit ast-grep preference, a syntax cheat sheet, and 6 compound pattern examples mined from benchmark failures.
  - **Bulk Sonnet recompile (#1224):** All 1156 lessons recompiled through Claude Sonnet — 438 → 393 rules, 102 regex→ast-grep upgrades, 143 noisy hallucinated rules purged. Quality > quantity is now enforced by the compile gate, not by manual curation.
  - **Backtick parser hardening (#1225):** Both Pipeline 1 (manual `**Pattern:**` extraction) and Pipeline 2 (LLM JSON output) strip code-fence wrappers from generated patterns so rules can never ship with backtick artifacts.
  - **Context telemetry (#1132, #1227):** `RuleMetric` now tracks the per-context match distribution — `{ code, string, comment, regex, unknown }`. The match context comes from the rule runner's `astContext` field; historical hits are seeded into the `unknown` bucket so legacy metrics remain interpretable.
  - **`totem doctor` upgrade diagnostic (#1131):** New `checkUpgradeCandidates` flags regex rules whose telemetry shows >20% of matches landing in non-code contexts (strings, comments, regex literals). Excludes the `unknown` bucket from the ratio math and requires a 5-event minimum-confidence floor. The legacy `ast` (Tree-sitter) engine is filtered out because its telemetry lands in `unknown` and can't be reasoned about.
  - **`totem compile --upgrade <hash>`:** Re-compile a single targeted rule by hash (full or short prefix). Scoped cache eviction preserves the rule's original `createdAt` metadata; failure paths leave the old rule intact (fail-safe); the `compiled` and `skipped` outcomes are handled consistently. Returns an `UpgradeOutcome { hash, status }` discriminant so callers can distinguish actual replacements from noop / skipped / failed. Rejects `--cloud` (cloud worker still on Gemini, tracked as #1221) and `--force` (the scoped eviction makes both flags redundant and dangerous).
  - **`totem doctor --pr` self-healing upgrade phase:** Slots after the existing downgrade and GC phases. Calls `compileCommand` in-process (no shelling out), only counts `'replaced'` outcomes as actual upgrades, stages `compile-manifest.json` alongside `compiled-rules.json`, and reverts the manifest when nothing changes so the working tree stays clean.
  - **AST empty catch (#664):** 8 empty-catch rules upgraded from the legacy Tree-sitter `#eq?` engine to `ast-grep` structural matching. Correctly handles parameterless catch blocks (ES2019+) and multi-line empty bodies that the predicate-based approach missed.
  - **Pipeline hygiene (#1210, #1211, #1214):** Wind tunnel skips auto-scaffolded TODO fixtures so empty placeholders don't dilute the gate signal. Extract pipeline runs heading-level exact-match deduplication before embedding similarity to short-circuit duplicate ingestion at zero cost. Config-drift test replaced its line-count limit on instructional files with a token-aware character + directive count limit.
  - **Lesson protection rule (governance):** A near-miss almost deleted `.totem/lessons.md` (which sources 41+ functional ast-grep rules) under the assumption it was legacy cruft. Encoded as a Pipeline 1 lint rule with severity `error` that flags the destructive shell command at the point of intent across all script and documentation files. When an agent makes a mistake, the right answer is a deterministic constraint, not a sticky note.
  - **Drift detector — shell prefix filter (core fix):** `extractFileReferences` in `@mmnto/totem` now skips backtick-wrapped strings starting with a recognizable shell command prefix (`rm`, `git rm`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat`, `less`, `head`, `tail`, `tee`, `chmod`, `chown`, `touch`). This is a pre-existing latent bug that surfaced when the lesson protection rule above put `git rm <path>` in its Example Hit / Miss lines — the detector was misparsing the shell command as a literal path and reporting it as orphaned. New unit test in `drift-detector.test.ts` locks in the behavior across all supported shell prefixes.

## 1.5.6

### Patch Changes

- fc607ce: ### 1.5.6 — Foundation & Hardening

  **Features:**
  - Unified Findings Model (`TotemFinding`) — common output schema for lint and shield (ADR-071)
  - `totem-context:` is now the primary override directive; `shield-context:` remains as silent alias
  - `totem lint --format json` now includes a `findings[]` array alongside `violations[]`
  - safe-regex validation for user-supplied DLP patterns — ReDoS-vulnerable patterns rejected at input time

  **Fixes:**
  - `matchesGlob()` now correctly handles `*.test.*` and `dir/*.test.*` patterns (was doing literal string match)
  - `readRegistry()` differentiates ENOENT from permission/parse errors via `onWarn` callback
  - `TotemParseError` used for schema validation failures (was generic `Error`)
  - Git hooks path resolved via `git rev-parse --git-path` (supports worktrees and custom `core.hooksPath`)
  - `shield-hints.ts` uses `log.dim()` instead of raw ANSI escape codes
  - `store.count()` failure no longer breaks sync
  - `maxBuffer` (10MB) added to git diff commands — prevents ENOBUFS on large branch diffs
  - Windows `ENOTEMPTY` flake fixed with `maxRetries` in test cleanup

  **Chores:**
  - Dynamic imports in `doctor.ts` for startup latency
  - 8 new lessons extracted from bot reviews (305 compiled rules)
  - Audited and removed 6 `totem-ignore` suppressions
  - Updated compiled baseline hash and scope for JSON.parse rule

  - Language-agnostic hook installation — hooks resolve `totem` binary at runtime via `command -v`, fall back to package manager `dlx` commands
  - Hook manager helper scripts — `.totem/hooks/*.sh` generated for Husky/Lefthook/simple-git-hooks integration
  - `userFacing` flag on DocTarget for scoped post-processing
  - Smart shield review hints — auto-detects DLP artifacts, test files, new files in diff
  - `// shield-context:` inline annotations for per-file shield guidance
  - `.totem/prompts/shield.md` override with verdict format enforcement

  **SARIF Improvements**
  - Tool name corrected: `totem-shield` → `totem-lint`
  - `helpUri` per rule links to wiki
  - Rich annotation messages with lesson context and rule ID

  **Research**
  - Binary distribution spike: full standalone blocked by LanceDB (144MB native), Lite-tier binary feasible

  **CI/DX**
  - Compile Manifest Attestation skips docs-only PRs via path filter
  - Wiki reorganization: internal docs converted to Totem lessons
  - Shield documentation: new "Working with Shield" wiki page

## 1.4.3

### Patch Changes

- DX hardening, core refactor, and docs overhaul.

  **Core:**
  - Extract `buildCompiledRule()`, `buildManualRule()`, `compileLesson()` to core package — eliminates duplicated rule-building logic between local and cloud compilation paths

  **CLI:**
  - Reduce pre-push hook verbosity: dot reporter by default, full output on failure, `TOTEM_DEBUG=1` for verbose mode
  - Suppress gh CLI stderr leak in multi-repo issue fetch
  - Extract shared `ghExecOptions()` with `GH_PROMPT_DISABLED=1` to prevent interactive auth hangs
  - Protect `<manual_content>` blocks from `stripMarketingTerms` mutation

  **Config:**
  - Remove `**/*.test.ts` from `ignorePatterns` so shield can see test files in diffs

  **Docs:**
  - Rewrite README as technical spec sheet (~130 lines, zero marketing)
  - Create SECURITY.md with full 1.4.x audit
  - Scaffold `docs/wiki/` with enforcement model, MCP setup, cross-repo mesh, troubleshooting
  - Add 6 placeholder wiki pages for 1.5.0 features

## 1.4.2

### Patch Changes

- f1509d3: Post-1.4.0 quality sweep (Proposal 189): security fixes, broken functionality, 154 new tests, quality hardening, DRY cleanup, and compile manifest CI attestation

## 1.4.1

### Patch Changes

- ec5b807: Security sweep: fix sanitizer regex statefulness (#871), secret pattern ordering (#872), extract parser injection vector (#873), SQL escaping (#874), and add compile manifest CI attestation (#875)

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

#### Security Hardening

### Core (`@mmnto/totem`)

- **AST engines fail-closed** — query/parse errors now throw `TotemParseError` instead of silently returning empty arrays (#848)
- **Compile manifest signing** — `totem compile` writes `.totem/compile-manifest.json` with SHA-256 provenance chain (#842)
- **XML trust boundaries** — new `wrapUntrustedXml()` for network-fetched content, existing `wrapXml()` preserved for trusted local diffs (#843)
- **Tag name validation** — both XML wrappers validate tag names against injection (#843)
- **DLP secret masking** — `maskSecrets()` utility with centralized `rethrowAsParseError` and `getErrorMessage` helpers (#848, #strategy-12)
- **247 compiled rules** (up from 230)

### CLI (`@mmnto/cli`)

- **Wind tunnel SHA lock** — `tools/update-wind-tunnel-sha.sh` with CI verification job (#840)
- **`totem verify-manifest`** — zero-LLM CI command to verify compiled rules match source lessons (#842)
- **Docs confirmation gate** — `totem docs` requires interactive confirmation or `--yes` before writing LLM output (#847)
- **Marketing term stripping** — case-preserving deterministic replacement, preserves code blocks and URLs (#833)
- **DLP middleware** — `maskSecrets` runs before every outbound LLM call, bypasses local providers (#strategy-12)

### MCP (`@mmnto/mcp`)

- **add_lesson auth model** — Zod schema validation, rate limiting (10/session), source provenance, heading sanitization (#844)

## 1.3.19

### Patch Changes

- feat: markdown-magic deterministic doc injection
  - Integrated markdown-magic with 4 transforms (RULE_COUNT, HOOK_LIST, CHMOD_HOOKS, COMMAND_TABLE)
  - Wired docs:inject into totem wrap pipeline (step 5/6, after LLM docs, before compile)
  - 9 unit tests for transforms, runs in 0.02s
  - Eliminates stale hardcoded values in docs across releases

## 1.3.18

### Patch Changes

- feat: invisible sync hooks (ADR-066)
  - Post-merge hook only syncs when `.totem/lessons/` files change (git diff-tree conditional)
  - New post-checkout hook syncs on branch switch when `.totem/` differs
  - `totem sync --quiet` flag for silent background hook execution
  - Deterministic end markers for safe eject scrubbing
  - DRY scrubHook helper with try/catch and exact marker matching
  - 230 compiled rules (19 new), 697 lessons

## 1.3.17

### Patch Changes

- God Object cleanup: extract.ts (804→566), shield.ts (587→475), audit.ts (560→510), lance-store.ts (523→285). Suspicious lesson detection + semantic dedup moved to core. Nit extraction from CodeRabbit review bodies. Compiler quality gate for untested error rules. Wind tunnel CI gate.

## 1.3.16

### Patch Changes

- Universal Baseline grows from 15 → 23 rules (8 Gemini-validated ast-grep patterns). Wind tunnel: 9 test fixtures + ast-grep test runner fix. Adversarial corpus (16 clean-room fixtures). TypeScript detection for monorepo per-package tsconfig.json.

## 1.3.15

### Patch Changes

- Rule audit Phase 4: kill bad patterns, scope noisy rules, extract lessons from PR 816. Full audit progression: 2,713 → 555 violations (0 on enforcement path).

## 1.3.14

### Patch Changes

- Rule audit: kill 70 garbage rules, dedup 18 overlaps (327 → 239). Docs prompt fix: strip issue refs from user-facing output. README cleanup.

## 1.3.13

### Patch Changes

- Spec template tests (#805), spec/compile prompt extraction (#806, #799), compiler utility tests, prompt versioning, post-compact gate strengthening

## 1.3.12

### Patch Changes

- Agent workflow doc, spec straitjacket upgrade (militant red flags + Graphviz), lean GEMINI.md, PostCompact agent discipline reminder

## 1.3.11

### Patch Changes

- 0b47c94: Security hardening: regex escape, shell:true removal, SQL backtick escape. CodeRabbit integration with path instructions. onWarn logging for AST catch blocks. Unsafe non-null assertions replaced.

## 1.3.10

### Patch Changes

- ceb8663: Context engineering (ADR-063): lean CLAUDE.md router pattern, PostCompact capability manifest, phase-gate enforcement (spec warning before commit). Fixed doc regen hallucination loop.

## 1.3.9

### Patch Changes

- 48cd644: Named index partitions for context isolation. Backfilled body text for 125 Pipeline 1 lessons. Consolidated near-duplicate rules (146 → 144).

## 1.3.8

### Patch Changes

## 1.3.6

### Patch Changes

- 09153f8: Pipeline 1 backfill: 127 curated rules now compile deterministically (zero LLM). Added .totem/lessons/ to .prettierignore. Workflow automation hooks and skills for Claude Code.

## 1.3.5

### Patch Changes

- 5810bcc: ### Knowledge Quality & Security
  - All 59 universal baseline lessons now include actionable Fix guidance — agents know HOW to resolve violations, not just WHAT is wrong (#642)
  - Path traversal containment check using path.relative prevents reads outside the project directory (#738)
  - Traversal skip now logs a warning via onWarn callback for visibility (#739)

## 1.3.4

### Patch Changes

- 98d56dc: ### Security & Compiler Hardening
  - `totem link` now requires explicit consent ("I understand") before creating cross-trust-boundary bridges. Bypass with `--yes` for CI/CD.
  - Shell orchestrator process termination uses process groups on Unix (prevents zombie processes)
  - SECURITY.md expanded with threat model, audit results, and Totem Mesh risks
  - Gate 1 (Proposal 184): Compiled rules now default to `severity: 'warning'` when LLM omits severity, preventing the #1 compiler regression
  - Added `severity` field to `CompilerOutputSchema`

## 1.3.3

## 1.3.2

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- ace02c0: ### Bug Fixes
  - **Critical:** Fixed filter ordering in `totem lint` and `totem shield` — ignored patterns (e.g., `.strategy` submodule) were checked after the emptiness test, preventing branch-diff fallback from firing. The Layer 3 pre-push gate was silently passing. (#709)
  - Fixed latent bug where AST rules with empty `pattern` fields could match every line when passed to the regex executor (#710)
  - Replaced 13 raw `throw new Error()` calls with typed `TotemError` subclasses across core and CLI packages (#711)

  ### Improvements
  - **Compiler facade refactor:** Split `compiler.ts` (600 lines) into focused modules — `compiler-schema.ts`, `diff-parser.ts`, `rule-engine.ts` — with `compiler.ts` as a clean coordinator. Public API unchanged. (#710)
  - Added `TOTEM_DEBUG=1` env var for full stack traces during troubleshooting (#711)
  - Added mandatory verify steps (lint + shield + verify_execution) to `totem spec` output (#708)
  - Reverted to curated 147-rule set and added 59 lesson hashes to nonCompilable blocklist (#708)

## 1.3.0

### Patch Changes

- a02f7f8: Release 1.3.0 — MCP verify_execution, spec inline invariants, baseline Fix guidance.

  ### Highlights
  - **MCP `verify_execution` tool**: AI agents can now mathematically verify their work before declaring a task done. Runs `totem lint` as a child process and returns pass/fail with violation details. Supports `staged_only` flag. Warns about unstaged changes.
  - **Spec inline invariant injection**: `totem spec` now outputs granular implementation tasks with Totem lessons injected directly into the steps where they apply. Closes the gap between "planning" and "doing."
  - **Baseline Fix suggestions**: 24 of 59 universal baseline lessons updated with explicit "Fix:" guidance. Every lesson now tells developers what TO do, not just what to avoid.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- baf6e15: Release 1.2.0 — ast-grep engine, compound rules, and shield CI hardening.

  ### Highlights
  - **ast-grep pattern engine**: Third rule engine alongside regex and Tree-sitter. Patterns look like source code (`process.env.$PROP`, `console.log($ARG)`) — dramatically easier for LLMs to generate accurately.
  - **ast-grep compound rules**: Full support for `has`/`inside`/`follows`/`not`/`all`/`any` operators via NapiConfig rule objects. Enables structural rules like "useEffect without cleanup."
  - **Shield CI hardening**: `shieldIgnorePatterns` now filters the diff before linting, preventing `.strategy` submodule pointer changes from triggering false CI failures.
  - **Dynamic import rules narrowed**: Code scanning alerts for dynamic imports in command files eliminated — rules now only apply to core/adapter code.
  - **Case-insensitive hash matching**: `totem explain` and `totem test --filter` now match regardless of case.
  - **README hardened**: Staff Engineer red team feedback addressed — deterministic enforcement, air-gapped operation, and git-committed artifacts all clarified.
  - **Docs injection scoped**: Manual content injection now targets README only, not all docs.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 4c0b2cd: Release 1.1.0 — Tier 2 AST engine, cross-totem queries, and totem explain.

  ### Highlights
  - **Tier 2 AST engine**: Compiled rules now support Tree-sitter S-expression queries alongside regex. Enables structural rule matching that regex alone can't express.
  - **Cross-totem queries**: New `linkedIndexes` config lets `totem spec` query knowledge from other totem-managed directories (e.g., strategy repos, design docs) alongside the primary project index.
  - **totem init --bare**: Zero-config initialization for non-code repositories — notes, docs, ADRs, infrastructure configs. No package.json required.
  - **totem explain**: Look up the full lesson behind any compiled rule violation. Supports partial hash prefix matching. Zero LLM, instant.
  - **TODO guardrail rules**: 3 new baseline rules catch `// TODO: implement` stubs, `throw new Error("Not implemented")`, and empty catch blocks. Baseline now ships 15 pre-compiled rules.
  - **Dimension mismatch detection**: `totem sync` writes `index-meta.json`. Switching embedding providers without rebuilding the index now throws a clear error instead of silently returning garbage results.
  - **Compiled rules reverted to curated set**: The 147 hand-audited rules are preserved. Blind recompilation with Flash produced regressions — compiler improvements tracked in #670.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- d49cdbf: Release 1.0.0 — Totem is production-ready.

  ### Highlights
  - **Zero-config lint protection**: `totem init` now ships 13 pre-compiled universal baseline rules. Every user gets deterministic lint protection from Day 1 — no API keys, no LLM calls required.
  - **Filesystem concurrency locks**: Sync and MCP mutations are now protected by PID-aware file locks with signal cleanup (SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP, SIGQUIT).
  - **Portability audit**: CLI help grouped by tier, `requireGhCli()` guard on GitHub commands, dynamic orchestrator detection, configurable bot markers, expanded issue URL regex for GitLab/self-hosted.
  - **TotemError consistency**: All error paths use structured `TotemError` hierarchy with recovery hints. Ollama model-not-found errors give actionable `ollama pull` instructions.
  - **MCP race condition fix**: `getContext()` uses promise memoization to prevent duplicate connections from concurrent callers, with retry on transient failures.
  - **Compiled rule audit**: 148 → 147 rules, 0 undefined severity, false positives on TotemError/type imports/stdlib imports eliminated.
  - **Manual docs survive regeneration**: `docs/manual/` content is injected verbatim into `totem docs` output.

## 0.44.0

### Minor Changes

- ab254bf: feat: migrate 54 throw sites to TotemError hierarchy

  Every error now includes a `recoveryHint` telling the user exactly how to fix it. New error classes: `TotemOrchestratorError`, `TotemGitError`. New error code: `GIT_FAILED`. Includes rule fix exempting error class imports from the static import lint rule.

## 0.43.0

## 0.42.0

### Minor Changes

- 557d046: feat: DLP secret masking — strip secrets before embedding (#534)

  Automatically masks API keys, tokens, passwords, and credentials with [REDACTED] before entering LanceDB. Preserves key names in assignments. Handles quoted and unquoted patterns.

  fix: compiler glob patterns — prompt constraints + brace expansion (#602)

  Compiler prompt now forbids unsupported glob syntax. Post-compile sanitizer expands brace patterns. Fixed 12 existing rules.

  fix: init embedding detection — Gemini first (#551)

  Reorders provider detection to prefer Gemini (task-type aware) over OpenAI when both keys present.

  fix: review blitz 2 — dynamic imports, onWarn, rule demotions (#575, #594, #595)

  compile.ts dynamic imports, loadCompiledRules onWarn callback, err.message rule demoted to warning.

  docs: Scope & Limitations section, Solo Dev Litmus Test styleguide rule

## 0.41.0

### Minor Changes

- 028786b: perf: cache non-compilable lessons to skip recompilation (#590)

  `totem compile` now caches lesson hashes that the LLM determined cannot be compiled. Subsequent runs skip them instantly. `totem wrap` goes from ~15 min to ~30 seconds.

  fix: remove duplicate compiled rule causing false positives (#589)

  Root cause was duplicate rules from compile, not a glob matching bug. Removed the broad duplicate.

  feat: auto-ingest cursor rules during totem init (#596)

  `totem init` scans for .cursorrules, .mdc, and .windsurfrules. If found, prompts user to compile them into deterministic invariants.

  fix: strip known-not-shipped issue refs from docs generation (#598)

  Ends the #515 hallucination that recurred in 5 consecutive releases. Pre-processing strips from git log, post-processing strips from LLM output.

## 0.40.0

### Minor Changes

- 99f8995: feat: .mdc / .cursorrules ingestion adapter (#555)

  New `totem compile --from-cursor` flag. Scans .cursor/rules/\*.mdc, .cursorrules, and .windsurfrules files. Parses frontmatter and plain text rules. Compiles them into deterministic Totem rules via the existing LLM pipeline.

  docs: README Holy Grail positioning (ADR-049)

  "A zero-config CLI that compiles your .cursorrules into deterministic CI guardrails. Stop repeating yourself to your AI." MCP as step 2, Solo Dev Superpower section, command table with speed metrics.

## 0.39.0

### Minor Changes

- dda8715: feat: shield severity levels — error vs warning (#498)

  Rules now support `severity: 'error' | 'warning'`. Errors block CI, warnings inform but pass. SARIF output maps severity to the `level` field. JSON output includes error/warning counts.

  chore: rule invariant audit — 137 rules categorized (#556)

  27 security (error), 56 architecture (error), 47 style (warning), 7 performance (warning). 39% reduction in hard blocks while maintaining all guidance.

  fix: auto-healing DB — dimension mismatch + version recovery (#500, #548)

  LanceStore.connect() auto-heals on embedder dimension mismatch and LanceDB version/corruption errors. Nukes .lancedb/ and reconnects empty for a clean rebuild.

## 0.38.0

### Minor Changes

- 89fcb02: feat: Trap Ledger Phase 1 — SARIF extension + enhanced totem stats

  Every `totem lint` violation now generates SARIF properties with eventId, ruleCategory, timestamp, and lessonHash. Rules support a `category` field (security/architecture/style/performance). `totem stats` shows "Total violations prevented" with category breakdown and top 10 prevented violations.

  fix: code review blitz — 7 findings from Claude+Gemini synthesis

  Critical: MCP loadEnv quote stripping, add_lesson race condition (promise memoization), SARIF format flag works with totem lint. High: extracted shared runCompiledRules (-75 lines), Gemini default model fixed, health check --rebuild → --full, lesson validation before disk write.

  fix: stale prompts — docs glossary, init model, reflex block v3

  Command glossary in docs system prompt prevents LLM confusing lint/shield. Gemini embedder model corrected in init. AI_PROMPT_BLOCK distinguishes lint (pre-push) from shield (pre-PR).

  chore: 137 compiled rules (39 new), 17 extracted lessons, docs sync

## 0.37.0

### Minor Changes

- 382c77a: feat: `totem lint` — new command for fast compiled rule checks (zero LLM)

  Split from `totem shield`. `totem lint` runs compiled rules against your diff in ~2 seconds with no API keys needed. `totem shield` is now exclusively the AI-powered code review. `--deterministic` flag is deprecated with a warning.

  feat: semantic rule observability (Phase 1)

  Rules now track `createdAt`, `triggerCount`, `suppressCount`, and `lastTriggeredAt` metadata. `totem stats` displays rule metrics. Foundation for automated rule decay analysis.

  fix: shield rule scoping — dynamic import and match/exec rules narrowed

  Dynamic import rule scoped to command files only (not adapters/orchestrators). match/exec rule scoped to security-sensitive code only. `.cjs` rule excludes CI workflow YAML.

## 0.36.0

### Minor Changes

- 74e521e: feat: graceful degradation for orchestrator and embedder providers

  Orchestrators (Gemini, Anthropic) now fall back to their CLI equivalents when the SDK or API key is missing. Embedders fall back to Ollama when the configured provider is unavailable. LazyEmbedder uses promise memoization to prevent race conditions with concurrent embed() calls.

  feat: configurable issue sources — support multiple repos in triage/extract/spec

  Add `repositories` field to `totem.config.ts`. When set, triage, audit, and spec commands aggregate issues from all listed repos. Supports `owner/repo#123` syntax for disambiguation.

  chore: switch default embedder to Gemini (gemini-embedding-2-preview)

  Task-type aware 768d embeddings replace OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (1536d). Requires `totem sync --full` after upgrade.

## 0.35.1

### Patch Changes

- 9cd061e: Bug blitz: four fixes from triage priorities.
  - **#396:** Anthropic orchestrator uses model-aware max_tokens (Haiku 4K, Sonnet 8K, Opus 16K)
  - **#397:** matchesGlob now supports single-star directory patterns (e.g., `src/*.ts`)
  - **#398:** extractChangedFiles handles quoted paths with spaces
  - **#399:** AST gate reads staged content (`git show :path`) before falling back to disk

## 0.35.0

### Minor Changes

- f6074c4: Upgrade @lancedb/lancedb from 0.13.0 to 0.26.2.
  - Fixes FTS (Full-Text Search) WAND panic (#491) — "pivot posting should have at least one document"
  - Lance engine upgraded from v0.19 to v2.0.0 — improved search performance, FTS stability, and cache efficiency
  - Users should run `totem sync --full` after upgrading to rebuild the index with the new engine format

## 0.34.0

## 0.33.1

## 0.33.0

### Minor Changes

- a91ca10: Agent hooks, rule testing harness, multi-domain MCP, and docs migration.
  - **CLI:** `totem test` command — TDD harness for compiled shield rules with pass/fail fixtures
  - **CLI:** Agent hooks reinstated — Claude PreToolUse shield gate, Gemini SessionStart + BeforeTool
  - **CLI:** Instruction file length enforcement (FR-C01, <50 lines)
  - **Core:** `parseFixture()`, `testRule()`, `runRuleTests()` — rule testing engine
  - **Core:** Export `matchesGlob` for shield file filtering
  - **MCP:** `--cwd` flag for multi-domain knowledge architecture (strategy Totem)
  - **MCP:** Robust `--cwd` validation with `[Totem Error]` prefix
  - **Shield:** `shieldIgnorePatterns` config field (separate from sync ignorePatterns)
  - **Shield:** Compiled rules respect ignorePatterns from config
  - **Shield:** execSync rule scoped to exclude hook scripts
  - **Shield:** Literal-file-path rule scoped to lesson files only (#457)
  - **Docs:** README-to-wiki migration — marketing-lean README + 5 new wiki pages
  - **Config:** Consumer hook templates use `--deterministic` shield

## 0.32.0

### Minor Changes

- bd40894: Agent config cleanup, shield ignorePatterns separation, and Junie support.
  - **Shield:** `shieldIgnorePatterns` config field separates shield exclusions from sync indexing
  - **Shield:** Deterministic shield now respects `ignorePatterns` from config
  - **Core:** Export `matchesGlob` for shield file filtering
  - **Init:** Fix Gemini CLI reflexFile path (`.gemini/gemini.md` → `GEMINI.md`)
  - **Init:** Export `AI_PROMPT_BLOCK` for drift test consumption
  - **MCP:** Replace empty catch blocks with `logSearch()` disk-based diagnostics
  - **Config:** Add `shieldIgnorePatterns` to config schema
  - **Junie:** Lean guidelines.md, correct MCP path (`.junie/mcp/mcp.json`), compiled rules as skill
  - **Drift Tests:** 41-assertion config drift test suite guarding hooks, agent configs, MCP scaffolding, and secrets

## 0.31.0

### Minor Changes

- feat: hybrid search (FTS + vector with RRF reranking), Gemini embedding provider, retrieval eval script
- feat: lessons directory migration — dual-read/single-write (per-file lessons replace monolithic lessons file)

## 0.30.0

### Patch Changes

- d0be9c6: Add compile --export as Step 5 of totem wrap, exclude export targets from deterministic shield, throw NoLessonsError in compile command

## 0.29.0

### Patch Changes

- e311aff: Lesson injection into all orchestrator commands, totem audit, and Junie docs.
  - **`totem audit`** — strategic backlog audit with human approval gate, interactive multi-select, shell injection prevention via `--body-file`, resilient batch execution (#362)
  - **Lesson injection** — vector DB lessons now injected into shield (full bodies), triage (condensed), and briefing (condensed) via shared `partitionLessons()` + `formatLessonSection()` helpers (#370)
  - **Junie docs** — MCP config example and export target docs in README (#371)
  - **Lesson ContentType** — `add_lesson` MCP tool now uses `lesson` content type for better vector DB filtering (#377)
  - **Versioned reflex upgrade** — `REFLEX_VERSION=2` with `detectReflexStatus()` and `upgradeReflexes()` for existing consumers (#375)
  - **Spec lesson injection** — lessons injected as hard constraints into `totem spec` output (#366)

## 0.28.0

### Minor Changes

- d221d54: Extraction Hardening: semantic dedup for `totem extract`, dangling-tail heading cleanup, submodule-aware file resolver, and CLI `--help` fix.

## 0.27.0

### Minor Changes

- 20c912d: feat: saga validator for `totem docs` — deterministic post-update validation catches LLM hallucinations (checkbox mutations, sentinel corruption, frontmatter deletion, excessive content loss) before writing to disk (#356)

  fix: scope deterministic shield rules with fileGlobs — 21 of 24 compiled rules now have package-level glob scoping, preventing MCP-specific rules from firing against the entire codebase. Also fixes `matchesGlob` to support directory-prefixed patterns like `packages/cli/**/*.ts` (#357)

## 0.26.1

## 0.26.0

## 0.25.0

### Minor Changes

- 0455d24: Adversarial ingestion scrubbing, eval harness, Bun support, and model audit
  - **Adversarial ingestion scrubbing:** `sanitizeForIngestion()` strips BiDi overrides (Trojan Source defense) from all content types and invisible Unicode from prose chunks. Suspicious patterns flagged via `onWarn` but never stripped. Detection regexes consolidated into core for DRY reuse. XML tag regex hardened against whitespace bypass.
  - **Adversarial evaluation harness:** Integration tests with planted architectural violations for model drift detection. Deterministic tests run without API keys; LLM tests gated behind `CI_INTEGRATION=true` for nightly runs against Gemini, Anthropic, and OpenAI.
  - **Bun support:** `detectTotemPrefix()` checks for both `bun.lockb` (legacy) and `bun.lock` (Bun >= 1.2). Priority: pnpm > yarn > bun > npx.
  - **Model audit:** Updated default orchestrator model IDs — Anthropic to `claude-sonnet-4-6`, OpenAI to `gpt-5.4`/`gpt-5-mini`.
  - **Supported models doc:** New `docs/supported-models.md` with provider model listing APIs and discovery scripts.

## 0.24.0

### Patch Changes

- 3b8e53b: feat: git hook enforcement — block main commits + deterministic shield gate

  `totem init` now installs two enforcement hooks alongside the existing post-merge hook:
  - **pre-commit**: blocks direct commits to `main`/`master` (override with `git commit --no-verify`)
  - **pre-push**: runs `totem shield --deterministic` before push, bails instantly if no compiled rules exist (zero Node startup penalty for Lite tiers)

  Both hooks are idempotent, chain-friendly (append to existing hooks without clobbering), and cross-platform. Non-shell hooks (Node/Python) are detected and safely skipped.

  Also fixes truncated lesson headings — `generateLessonHeading` no longer appends ellipsis on truncation, and the extract prompt uses positive structural constraints for better LLM compliance.

## 0.23.0

### Minor Changes

- 83923f0: Add native Ollama orchestrator provider with dynamic `num_ctx` support
  - New `provider: 'ollama'` orchestrator config hits Ollama's native `/api/chat` endpoint directly via fetch (no SDK required)
  - Supports `numCtx` option to dynamically control context length and VRAM usage per-command
  - VRAM-friendly error messages on 500 errors suggest lowering `numCtx`
  - Connection errors suggest running `ollama serve`
  - Mirrors the existing `ollama-embedder` pattern (plain fetch, baseUrl defaulting)

## 0.22.0

### Minor Changes

- b3a07b8: ### 0.22.0 — AST Gating, OpenAI Orchestrator, Security Hardening

  **New Features**
  - **Tree-sitter AST gating** for deterministic shield — reduces false positives by classifying diff additions as code vs. non-code (#287)
  - **Generic OpenAI-compatible orchestrator** — supports OpenAI API, Ollama, LM Studio, and any OpenAI-compatible local server via BYOSD pattern (#285, #293)
  - **`totem handoff --lite`** — zero-LLM session snapshots with ANSI-sanitized git output (#281, #288)
  - **CI drift gate** with adversarial evaluation harness (#280)
  - **Concise lesson headings** — shorter, more searchable headings from extract (#271, #278)

  **Security Hardening**
  - Extract prompt injection hardening with explicit SECURITY NOTICE for untrusted PR fields (#279, #289, #295)
  - Path containment checks in drift detection to prevent directory traversal (#284)
  - ANSI terminal injection sanitization in handoff and git metadata (#292)

  **Bug Fixes**
  - GCA on-demand review configuration fixes (#278, #282)
  - GitHub Copilot lesson export confirmed working via existing `config.exports` (#294)

## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- e252d41: ### New Features
  - **`totem shield --mode=structural`** — Context-blind code review that catches syntax-level bugs (asymmetric validation, copy-paste drift, brittle tests, off-by-one errors) without Totem knowledge retrieval (#270)
  - **`totem compile --export`** — Cross-model lesson export via sentinel-based injection into AI assistant config files (#269)

  ### Improvements
  - Provider conformance suite with 15 tests and nightly smoke tests (#263)
  - CLA automation via `contributor-assistant/github-action` (#266)
  - Dependabot configured for security-only npm scanning and GitHub Actions version pinning (#272)
  - GitHub Actions updated: `actions/checkout` v4→v6, `actions/setup-node` v4→v6 (#273, #274)
  - Project docs and lessons synced via `totem wrap` (#275)

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- fff1f27: Inline suppression directives (`totem-ignore` / `totem-ignore-next-line`) for deterministic shield, cross-provider `provider:model` routing with negated glob support, and relicense to Apache 2.0.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- feat: discriminated union config and fileGlobs scoping
  - Extract shared orchestrator interface with discriminated union config schema
  - Add `fileGlobs` scoping for compiled shield rules

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- feat: async orchestrator and ReDoS protection
  - Refactored shell orchestrator from `execSync` to async `spawn` with streaming stdout/stderr, 50MB safety cap, and proper timeout handling (#206)
  - Added compile-time ReDoS static analysis via `safe-regex2` — vulnerable regex patterns are rejected during `totem compile` with diagnostic reasons (#218)
  - Graceful per-doc error handling in `totem docs` — a single doc failure no longer aborts the entire batch

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 03372b4: feat: drift detection for self-cleaning memory (#181)

  Adds `totem sync --prune` to detect and interactively remove lessons with stale file references. The drift detector scans `.totem/lessons.md` for backtick-wrapped file paths that no longer exist in the project, then presents an interactive multi-select for pruning. After pruning, the vector index is automatically re-synced.

  New core exports: `parseLessonsFile`, `extractFileReferences`, `detectDrift`, `rewriteLessonsFile`.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- Universal baseline lessons during `totem init` (#128), orphaned temp file cleanup on CLI startup (#108), and automated doc sync via `totem docs` command (#190) integrated into `totem wrap` as Step 4/4.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

## 0.9.1

## 0.9.0

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 9ec7ffd: ### CLI UX Polish
  - **Branded CLI output** — All commands now display colored, tagged output via `picocolors` (cyan brand, green success, yellow warnings, red errors, dim metadata)
  - **Ora spinners** — `totem sync` shows a TTY-aware spinner that gracefully falls back to static lines in CI/piped environments
  - **ASCII banner** — `totem init` displays a branded Totem banner on startup
  - **Colored Shield verdict** — `totem shield` now shows PASS in green and FAIL in red

  ### Custom Prompt Overrides
  - **`.totem/prompts/<command>.md`** — Override the built-in system prompt for any orchestrator command (spec, shield, triage, briefing, handoff, learn) by placing a markdown file in your project
  - **Path traversal protection** — Command names are validated against a strict regex pattern

  ### Multi-Argument Commands
  - **`totem spec <inputs...>`** — Pass multiple issue numbers, URLs, or topics in a single invocation (max 5, deduplicated)
  - **`totem learn <pr-numbers...>`** — Extract lessons from multiple PRs in one command with a single confirmation gate

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Unify gh-utils and PrAdapter, comprehensive test audit, bug fixes
  - Extracted shared `gh-utils` with `ghFetchAndParse` and `handleGhError`
