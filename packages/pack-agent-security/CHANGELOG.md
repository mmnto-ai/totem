## 1.14.15

### Patch Changes

- 89ca890: Extend the compile-time smoke gate with an over-matching check via `goodExample` (mmnto-ai/totem#1580).

  The gate now verifies both directions: the rule MUST match its `badExample` (under-matching check, in place since #1408) AND MUST NOT match its `goodExample` (over-matching check, new). A rule that fires on both sides is over-broad and produces false positives on every lint run, which was the dominant defect class observed in the 2026-04-18 security-pack postmerge incident (10-of-10 bad rate from #1526).

  `CompilerOutputSchema.goodExample` flips from optional to engine-conditional required for regex and ast-grep engines, mirroring the #1420 flip for `badExample`. The `ast` engine (Tree-sitter S-expression queries) remains exempt because the smoke gate does not yet evaluate those. `CompiledRuleSchema.goodExample` stays optional on the persisted-rule boundary for backward compat with pre-#1580 rules.

  Two new reason codes added to `NonCompilableReasonCodeSchema`: `matches-good-example` (over-match rejection) and `missing-goodexample` (defensive path for callers that bypass the schema refine). Rejected lessons surface in the `nonCompilable` ledger with the correct code so `totem doctor` and downstream telemetry can distinguish over-match rejections from other skip categories.

  Pipeline 3 automatically threads the lesson's Good snippet through as `goodExampleOverride`; Pipeline 2 requires the LLM to emit `goodExample` alongside `badExample` via the updated compiler prompt. Pipeline 1 (manual) is unaffected — the gate is opt-in via `enforceSmokeGate`.

  Closes #1580.

## 1.14.14

### Patch Changes

- e073dc0: Flip Pipeline 5 auto-capture on `totem review` from opt-out to opt-in.

  `--no-auto-capture` is renamed to `--auto-capture`; the default is now OFF. Observation rules captured from review findings are context-less (regex drawn from the flagged line, message taken from the reviewer, `fileGlobs` scoped to the whole codebase) and routinely pollute `compiled-rules.json` with rules that fire on unrelated files. The Liquid City Session 6 audit measured an 8-rule wave across 5 review invocations producing 13 new warnings on the next `totem lint`, up from 0.

  To preserve the old behavior, pass `--auto-capture` explicitly. Auto-capture will resume as a default once ADR-091 Stage 2 Classifier + Stage 4 Codebase Verifier ship in 1.16.0 and the LLM-emitted rule loop has gates that prevent context-less emissions.

  Closes #1579.
