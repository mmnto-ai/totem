feat(autoclose): GitHub auto-close enforcement-seam guard — D1 + D2-observe + C (#1762)

Adds the ruled Layer-1 slice of the GitHub auto-close guard: a defense against a
close-keyword adjacent to an issue reference (`Closes #131`, and — the confirmed
#2471→#2466 incident — even a negated `Does not close #2466`) reaching a PR body
or squash merge-commit body and auto-closing a linked issue.

- **Core** ships `@mmnto/totem` `autoclose` — the ONE shared evaluator
  (`AUTO_CLOSE_REGEX_SOURCE` / `findAutoCloseRefs`) plus the D1 corpus scan
  (`scanPrCorpus`), the durable receipt (`buildReceipt`), and the D2
  observation-mode reconciler (`reconcile`). Presence invariant, zero semantics:
  any close-keyword-adjacent ref is an anomaly (genuine, negated, quoted,
  emphasized alike — no negation parser). Qualified `owner/repo#N` refs match
  too; comment bodies are never scanned. Intended closures ride
  `closingIssuesReferences` or a structured `<!-- totem-close: #N -->` marker.

- **CLI** extends the hand-written hook templates (`init-templates.ts`) — the
  Claude PreWriteShield and the Gemini BeforeTool parity surface — to block
  close-keyword-adjacent refs in `**/*.md` writes (EXEMPT `.github/**`), sharing
  core's `AUTO_CLOSE_REGEX_SOURCE`. No new managed session hook; the roster is
  unchanged. The compiled-rule mirror stays frozen pending the Convergent Spine.

Also wires two workflow-only mechanisms (no package impact): a PR-time required
check (D1) that fails on any undeclared close-keyword ref and persists the
declared set as a receipt, and a push-to-main reconciliation (D2) in OBSERVATION
MODE that alerts loud on an anomaly / missing / ambiguous receipt and never
auto-reopens (the Tenet 9 sense→enforce gate).

Provenance: 1 confirmed instance (#2471→#2466) plus 4 asserted-prior
(undocumented). The Bash-matcher interlock (A) and `totem pr merge` wrapper (B)
are gated separately and not included here.
